## D-001 — Monorepo (pnpm workspaces)

- **Decision:** One repository with `apps/web`, `apps/worker`, and shared `packages/*`.
- **Reason:** The web app and the worker must share the Prisma client, provider adapters, the RBAC
  engine, and domain types. Two repositories would duplicate all of it, violating §42.
- **Alternatives:** Separate repos with a published internal package (versioning overhead, slow
  iteration); a single Next.js app with no worker (impossible — see D-002).
- **Impact:** CI builds two deployable artifacts; boundary rules enforced by lint.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-002 — Workers run on AWS ECS Fargate, not Vercel

- **Decision:** Next.js on Vercel; BullMQ workers as a container service on ECS Fargate.
- **Reason:** Vercel Functions are request-scoped and cap at 800s (1800s beta). A BullMQ worker is a
  long-lived process holding a blocking Redis connection — it is not expressible as a function. §51
  already names "Vercel + AWS", so this makes the split explicit rather than discovering it late.
- **Alternatives:** Vercel Cron polling a queue (poor latency, no concurrency control, still
  request-bounded); Inngest/QStash (removes BullMQ, adds a vendor and a different execution model —
  reasonable, but §27 names BullMQ); everything on AWS including the web app (loses Vercel's
  Next.js integration).
- **Impact:** A second deployment target, a Dockerfile, ECS task definitions, and autoscaling. The
  web app is forbidden from constructing a BullMQ `Worker`.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-003 — Redis on Upstash for MVP

- **Decision:** Managed Redis reachable over public TLS from both Vercel and ECS.
- **Reason:** AWS ElastiCache is VPC-private and not reachable from Vercel serverless functions
  without Secure Compute (Enterprise) or a VPC/NAT arrangement. Upstash removes that problem on day
  one.
- **Alternatives:** ElastiCache + all enqueues proxied through an internal API on ECS (cheaper at
  scale, more moving parts now, and it couples the web app's availability to the worker's);
  ElastiCache + Vercel Enterprise (cost).
- **Impact:** Per-command pricing; BullMQ requires `maxRetriesPerRequest: null` and
  `enableReadyCheck: false`. Revisit if command volume makes it expensive.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED — **blocked on Q2**

## D-004 — Firebase Auth for identity; authorization in Postgres

- **Decision:** Firebase Auth owns credentials, verification, reset, Google sign-in, and (later) MFA.
  Roles and memberships live in Postgres and are read on every request. Only `isPlatformAdmin` is
  mirrored into a custom claim.
- **Reason:** §51 mandates Firebase Auth. Custom claims cap at 1000 bytes, refresh lazily (up to an
  hour stale), and cannot express per-workspace/per-brand grants for a user in several orgs.
  Revocation must be immediate (§5: never trust role information from the client).
- **Alternatives:** All roles in custom claims (size and staleness); a second session store
  (redundant with the DB read we already make).
- **Impact:** One extra query per request, cached ~30s. A third cloud vendor (GCP) alongside Vercel
  and AWS — the Firebase dependency is confined to `packages/auth` so it stays replaceable.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-005 — Tenant isolation: scoped data layer primary, RLS as backstop

- **Decision:** `organizationId` on every tenant table; a tenant-scoped Prisma client injects it into
  every query; Postgres RLS policies provide an independent second layer.
- **Reason:** §4 demands server-side isolation that survives manual API manipulation. One mechanism
  is a single point of failure; two independent ones are not.
- **Alternatives:** RLS only (fragile with Prisma's connection handling as the *sole* control);
  application checks only (one forgotten `where` is a breach); schema- or database-per-tenant
  (migration and ops burden unjustified at ~100 orgs).
- **Impact:** A `SET LOCAL` inside each transaction; a runtime guard that throws on un-scoped tenant
  queries; a mandatory cross-tenant 404 test per endpoint. Requires a Postgres where we can create
  roles and policies (**Q3**).
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-006 — `PostVariant` (per social account) is the unit of publishing

- **Decision:** One variant per (post × social account). Platform-level editing is a UI affordance
  that writes through to that platform's variants.
- **Reason:** External post IDs, failures, retries, and analytics are all per account. Two Pages on
  one post need two independent outcomes even with identical copy.
- **Alternatives:** Per-platform variants joined to accounts (same data, more indirection at publish
  time and an awkward place to store `externalPostId`).
- **Impact:** Adds `PARTIALLY_PUBLISHED` to the §10 status enum, since a post can succeed on one
  target and fail on another. Flagged for confirmation.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-007 — Status and production stage are separate models

- **Decision:** `Post.status` implements the §10 lifecycle; `ProductionTask` rows implement the §11
  pipeline with their own assignees and states.
- **Reason:** §10 and §11 are different axes. A post can be in `DRAFT` while its *Design* stage is
  assigned and in progress. One flat enum cannot express that.
- **Alternatives:** A merged enum (loses assignment); stages as tags (no state or ownership).
- **Impact:** Two tables and a rule: a post cannot leave `DRAFT` while a blocking production task is
  open. `ProductionTask` ships in P0 as schema only; its UI is P1.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-008 — Publishing idempotency: four layers, with reconciliation

- **Decision:** (1) deterministic BullMQ `jobId`; (2) an atomic DB claim
  (`UPDATE … WHERE status='SCHEDULED' RETURNING`); (3) a Redis lock per account around the provider
  call; (4) a **reconciliation read before any retry that follows an ambiguous outcome**.
- **Reason:** Facebook's `/feed` accepts no client idempotency key, so a timeout genuinely cannot be
  interpreted. §13 forbids double-publishing on retries, crashes, and timeout ambiguity — layers 1–3
  prevent concurrent duplicates but cannot resolve ambiguity; only layer 4 can.
- **Alternatives:** Retry blindly (double posts — unacceptable); never retry (spurious failures);
  a provider idempotency key (does not exist here).
- **Impact:** `reconcile()` added to the `SocialProvider` interface — a deliberate departure from
  §8's sketch, which §8 permits. An inconclusive reconciliation parks the variant in `NEEDS_REVIEW`
  for a human; the system never guesses.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-009 — Scheduler sweeps the database; it does not create delayed jobs per post

- **Decision:** A repeatable job every 30s selects due variants (partial index) and enqueues them.
  Scheduling tolerance ±60s.
- **Reason:** Keeps the database the single source of truth. With one delayed job per post,
  rescheduling and cancellation become queue surgery, and a Redis loss loses the schedule.
- **Alternatives:** One delayed BullMQ job per variant (second-level precision, brittle on
  reschedule); a cron per minute (worse tolerance, same design).
- **Impact:** Publishing may land up to ~60s after the requested time. Confirm this is acceptable
  (`00-ANALYSIS.md` B12).
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-010 — Analytics metrics stored as jsonb with an availability map

- **Decision:** `metrics` and `availability` jsonb columns, plus the provider API version, on each
  snapshot. Metric names are provider-versioned configuration.
- **Reason:** Providers expose genuinely different metrics, and Meta's set is actively churning —
  `page_impressions` and `page_fans` were removed on 2025-11-15, with a further wave on 2026-06-15,
  and deprecated metrics now return an error rather than an empty result. §18 requires unavailable
  metrics to be *clearly indicated*, never fabricated.
- **Alternatives:** Typed columns per metric (a migration every provider change); a normalised
  metric/value table (more joins, slower charts).
- **Impact:** A typed accessor layer over jsonb; generated columns added later if profiling demands.
  Facebook figures will not match historical Meta Business Suite reports — the agency must be told
  before the first client report.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-011 — Modular Next.js server, not NestJS

- **Decision:** Route handlers and server actions over domain services in `packages/core`.
- **Reason:** §27's stated default. NestJS would add a second runtime, deployment target, and DI
  framework for no benefit at this size; the genuinely non-HTTP work lives in the worker, which is a
  plain Node process.
- **Alternatives:** NestJS (§27 requires justification — we have none); a separate Express API
  (duplicates auth and tenancy).
- **Impact:** Domain logic must stay out of route handlers so the API can be extracted later if it
  ever needs to serve third parties at volume.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-012 — Client portal is a separate surface, not a filtered agency view

- **Decision:** Its own route group, its own services, its own narrowed selects, its own tests.
- **Reason:** §21 requires that no internal information leaks. A shared endpoint with a role filter
  makes every future field addition a potential leak; the safe default must be structural.
- **Alternatives:** Shared endpoints with response filtering (one forgotten field is a breach);
  a separate application (duplicated auth and deployment).
- **Impact:** Some duplication between agency and portal read paths — accepted deliberately. Portal
  responses are asserted leak-free at the **payload** level in tests.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-013 — Media: presigned direct upload, then server-side byte verification

- **Decision:** Browser uploads straight to S3 via a presigned `PUT`; a worker then verifies the
  actual bytes (magic number, real dimensions, duration) before the asset becomes `READY`.
- **Reason:** Keeps large files out of serverless functions, and §17 requires real MIME validation —
  a client-declared content type is an assertion, not a fact.
- **Alternatives:** Upload through the API (function size and duration limits); trust the declared
  MIME (unsafe).
- **Impact:** A two-phase upload UX; assets are unusable until verification passes. Object keys are
  derived from a generated id, never from the user's filename.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED

## D-014 — Recommend a minimal approval gate in MVP

- **Decision:** `INTERNAL_REVIEW`, `CLIENT_REVIEW`, approve / request-changes, and a read-only client
  approval queue ship in P0. The full portal stays P1.
- **Reason:** §49 makes approval workflows the product's identity, and retrofitting an approval state
  machine beneath live published content is materially more expensive than building it now.
- **Alternatives:** Strict §39 phasing (approvals in Phase 2) — cheaper this month, more expensive
  overall, and the MVP would not be usable with real clients.
- **Impact:** ~8 points added to Phase 1. **This is a recommendation, not a unilateral scope change**
  — see **Q4**. If declined, the `Approval` schema ships anyway so the status enum does not change
  under live data.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** PROPOSED — **blocked on Q4**

## D-015 — Composite tenant foreign keys

- **Decision:** Every reference between two tenant-scoped tables is a composite
  foreign key `(organizationId, childId) → Parent(organizationId, id)`, backed by
  a `@@unique([organizationId, id])` on each parent. 34 constraints, 12 new
  unique indexes.
- **Reason:** A single-column `brandId` foreign key only checks that the brand
  *exists*, not that it belongs to the same organization. The tenant-scoped
  client stamps `organizationId` correctly, so a mixed-tenant row was
  unreachable through any service that resolved its parents through that client
  — but that was a **convention**, not a guarantee, and conventions are exactly
  what a security model should not rest on. Found while writing the T1.2
  cross-tenant tests and originally shipped as a documented gap.
- **Alternatives:** application-level validation in every service (forgettable,
  and invisible when forgotten); a trigger per table (more moving parts, worse
  error messages); accepting the risk (rejected — the user asked for
  database-level guarantees wherever reasonably possible).
- **Impact:**
  - Optional references (`MediaAsset.brandId`/`.folderId`, `AIUsage.brandId`,
    `Post.sourceIdeaId`) changed from `SET NULL` to `NO ACTION`: `SET NULL` on a
    composite key would try to null `organizationId`, which is `NOT NULL`.
    `NO ACTION` is checked at end-of-statement, so a cascading organization
    delete still succeeds, while deleting a still-referenced brand or folder is
    refused. Brands and folders are soft-deleted in normal operation.
  - Nested creates now **inherit** `organizationId` from the parent and reject
    an explicit one — cross-tenant nesting became impossible by construction.
  - `User` references (`createdById`, `assignedToId`, `uploadedById`, …) cannot
    be composite: a user genuinely spans organizations, so no
    `(organizationId, id)` key exists for them. These remain application-enforced
    and are the one residual gap — see the note below.
- **Date:** 2026-08-11 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED (migration
  `20260811000400_composite_tenant_foreign_keys`)

## D-016 — The edit lock applies to content edits, not to transitions

- **Context:** `post:update` carries `requiresEditable`, and
  `assertTransitionAllowed` evaluates a transition's permission against the
  **source** status. The reopen transitions (`APPROVED → DRAFT`,
  `SCHEDULED → DRAFT`) are therefore checked with an edit-locked source, so the
  policy denied them for every role including Owner. The transition table's
  `voidsApprovals: true` on those two rules was unreachable code, and there was
  no way back from APPROVED at all. Found by a T1.9 integration test, not by
  inspection.
- **Options:**
  1. Give reopening its own permission (`post:reopen`) and grant rows.
  2. Exempt transitions from the `requiresEditable` gate.
  3. Drop `requiresEditable` from `post:update` and rely on the service's
     `assertEditable`.
- **Decision:** option 2. `ResourceScope` gained
  `intent?: 'EDIT' | 'TRANSITION'`, defaulting to `EDIT`, and the
  `requiresEditable` gate is skipped only for `TRANSITION`.
- **Why:** the edit lock exists to stop *content* being mutated after approval,
  which is what `updatePost`'s `assertEditable` enforces directly. For a status
  change the transition table is already the authority on what is legal from a
  locked status, and it deliberately lists exactly the reopen and cancel paths.
  Option 1 adds a permission that would have to be granted to every role that
  can already edit, restating the same fact twice. Option 3 would remove the
  lock from the policy layer entirely, weakening `can()` for the UI.
- **What this does not weaken:** `intent: 'TRANSITION'` is set in exactly one
  place — `assertTransitionAllowed`, and only *after* the state machine has
  confirmed the transition exists. The reachable set from a locked status is
  still precisely the transition table's. Status-restricted grants
  (`grant.statuses`, e.g. a Client only at `CLIENT_REVIEW`) are unaffected, and
  content mutation still evaluates as `EDIT`. All three properties are pinned by
  unit tests in `packages/rbac/src/policy.test.ts`.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-017 — Approvals ride the post state machine; they are not a second one

- **Context:** T1.10 needed a way to record review decisions. An `Approval` table
  with its own `state` could easily have become a parallel workflow engine, with
  two places that decide where a post goes and an inevitable drift between them.
- **Decision:** `decideApproval` computes the resulting status from pure domain
  logic (`packages/core/approvals.ts`), then calls `transitionPost` — the same
  machine, the same permission check, the same validation, the same audit row as
  the direct `/transition` endpoint. The decision row is stamped inside that
  transition's transaction via an `onTransition` hook, so it commits with the
  status change or not at all. Gates are opened by the transition too, never by
  a separate endpoint.
- **Consequences:** there is exactly one path a post's status can move along.
  A reviewer who lacks the right for the resulting transition is refused by the
  existing grant matrix, with no approval-specific authorization code to keep in
  step.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-018 — `Post.approvalRequired` means *client* approval, and cannot be skipped

- **Context:** `docs/RBAC.md` §5 records `INTERNAL_REVIEW → APPROVED` as
  available to Acct Mgr, Admin and Owner *"when client approval is not
  required"*. Nothing enforced the parenthetical: T1.9 let an internal approver
  move any post straight to APPROVED, skipping the client entirely.
- **Decision:** `Post.approvalRequired` (default `true`) means the client gate
  applies. While it does, `INTERNAL_REVIEW → APPROVED` is refused with a 409 for
  every role including Owner, and the only way on is `CLIENT_REVIEW`. Approving
  the internal gate on such a post therefore *sends it to the client* rather than
  finishing review — which is what `statusAfterDecision` encodes.
- **Why not the transition table:** the rule depends on the post's own data, not
  on the status pair, so the table cannot express it. It lives in
  `transitionPost` beside the other post-dependent guards.
- **Note for review:** this makes the default posture "the client must approve".
  Agencies that work on standing approval will set `approvalRequired: false` per
  post; a workspace- or brand-level default is a reasonable later addition.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-019 — Leaving a review status closes the gate, independently of `voidsApprovals`

- **Context:** found by a T1.10 integration test. Gates were closed only on
  transitions marked `voidsApprovals` (the two reopens). Requesting changes from
  `CLIENT_REVIEW` moves the post on but is not a reopen — so the client's gate
  stayed `PENDING` in their queue forever, on a post that was no longer with them.
- **Decision:** two distinct rules, kept apart in `transitionPost`:
  *the post left the status the gate belonged to* (close it, whatever moved it),
  and *this transition invalidates approvals already granted* (`voidsApprovals`).
  Cancelling closes gates too.
- **Ordering:** the `onTransition` hook runs *before* the gate bookkeeping,
  because a reviewer's decision stamps the very record that bookkeeping would
  otherwise cancel. Once stamped it is no longer `PENDING` and is left alone.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-020 — Retry policy lives in the worker, not in BullMQ's `attempts`

- **Context:** BullMQ can retry a job itself with `attempts` + `backoff`. Using
  it would have been less code.
- **Decision:** jobs are added with `attempts: 1`. A failed attempt is
  re-enqueued deliberately by `runAttempt` after `decideRetry` has consulted the
  error taxonomy, with the attempt number carried in the payload.
- **Why:** BullMQ's attempt counter cannot express two of our three outcomes.
  A **rate limit** must reschedule at the provider's `retryAfter` *without*
  consuming an attempt — otherwise a busy queue turns into a failed post. A
  **`PublishingTimeoutError`** must not be retried at all until something has
  reconciled with the provider, because the post may already exist; encoding it
  as a number would silently convert an ambiguous publish into a duplicate one.
  Retryability is a property of the error, which `AppError.retryable` already
  records, so a new provider error gets correct behaviour with nothing to update
  in the queue layer.
- **Cost:** we own the re-enqueue path, including the `__attempt` field. The
  whole decision surface is pure and unit-tested without Redis.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-021 — A job's tenant is derived from its subject row, never from its payload

- **Context:** a job payload must name its work, and that includes an
  `organizationId`. Handing the worker a scoped client built from that value
  would make the queue a trust boundary we do not control: a queue is durable
  shared state, and a stale job, a hand-inserted entry or a producer bug could
  all put the wrong tenant there.
- **Decision:** every tenant-scoped processor resolves its subject row by
  primary key first and derives the tenant from **that row**. The payload's
  `organizationId` is only ever *compared*; a mismatch is a
  `TenantIsolationError` and a `securityEvent` log line, and the job fails.
  `resolveJobTenant` is the only sanctioned path, and `resolveTenantForJob` in
  `apps/worker/src/context.ts` is the only place an unscoped read happens —
  selecting nothing but `organizationId`, to *build* a scope rather than bypass
  one.
- **Note:** this supersedes the comment in `packages/auth/src/system.ts` that
  said "the organization id still comes from the job payload". It no longer
  does.
- **Why not reconcile in favour of one side:** both readings cannot be right,
  and guessing which is the actual hazard.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-022 — The web app produces; only the worker consumes

- **Context:** T1.11's DoD requires that the web app never constructs a
  `Worker`. Next.js makes this easy to violate by accident — an import in a
  shared module is all it takes.
- **Decision:** three independent guards. `@orbit/queue` splits into a producer
  half (`enqueue`, `cancelJob`, `queueDepths`) and a consumer half
  (`startWorker`, `blockingConnection`, `installShutdownHandlers`); ESLint
  refuses the consumer imports from `apps/web`; and `assertWorkerProcess()`
  throws at runtime unless `ORBIT_ROLE=worker`.
- **Why all three:** the lint rule catches the mistake at authoring time, the
  runtime guard catches the *deployment* mistake of running a bundle with the
  wrong role, and the module split makes the boundary legible without either.
  A `Worker` inside a web server would hold blocking Redis connections across
  request lifecycles it does not control, start one consumer per instance, and
  make queue concurrency a side effect of HTTP autoscaling.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-023 — DST edges resolve differently for a picked time and a recurring slot

- **Context:** a wall-clock time in a zone does not always name exactly one
  instant. Spring forward leaves a **gap** (02:30 never happens), autumn back
  leaves an **overlap** (01:30 happens twice). Every scheduling feature has to
  decide what those mean, and the honest answer differs by case.
- **Decision:**
  - A **time a person picked** that falls in a gap is **rejected**, with a
    message saying the clocks go forward and to pick again. Silently moving
    someone's 01:30 to 02:30 is a worse surprise than an error at the moment
    they can still fix it.
  - A **recurring queue slot** in a gap **shifts forward** to the first instant
    that exists. Rejecting would silently drop one week's post twice a year,
    which is a bigger failure than publishing half an hour late once.
  - An **overlap** takes the **earlier** occurrence in both cases. Publishing
    early is more predictable than publishing late, and the alternative is
    arbitrary.
- **Implementation:** `NonexistentTimePolicy` and `AmbiguousTimePolicy` in
  `packages/core/src/timezone.ts`; the defaults differ between `resolveSchedule`
  (REJECT) and `nextQueueSlot` (SHIFT_FORWARD). An ambiguous schedule is logged
  so a support question has an answer.
- **Both transitions are asserted explicitly** in `timezone.test.ts` for
  `Europe/London`, `America/New_York` (different dates from Europe — where naive
  code breaks) and `Australia/Sydney` (southern hemisphere, inverted seasons),
  with `Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh` proving a no-DST zone stays boring.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-024 — Timezone arithmetic uses `Intl`, not a library

- **Context:** scheduling needs IANA zone conversion including DST. The obvious
  move is `date-fns-tz` or `luxon`.
- **Decision:** neither. Node ships full ICU, so `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with a
  `timeZone` gives the tz database directly, and the conversions we actually
  need are about sixty lines.
- **Why:** a timezone library's value is its bundled tz data, which is also its
  liability — stale data means wrong publish times, and remembering to bump it
  is exactly the maintenance that gets skipped. Node's ICU updates with Node.
  The dependency would also have crossed into `packages/core`, which currently
  has none beyond Node built-ins.
- **Cost:** we own the gap/overlap logic. It is pure, and covered by 33 tests
  including both transitions in three zones.
- **Note:** the first implementation had a real bug — it probed only *forward*
  from its first guess and so missed overlaps where that guess had already
  landed on the later occurrence (London, unlike New York). The current version
  enumerates every instant matching the wall time and classifies by count, so
  there is no direction to get backwards.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## D-025 — The scheduler sweep gets its own queue

- **Context:** T1.11 shipped `maintenance` at concurrency 1 for housekeeping.
  The 30-second sweep could have shared it.
- **Decision:** a separate `scheduler` queue, also concurrency 1, carrying
  `sweep-due` and `report-stale`.
- **Why:** at concurrency 1 a slow retention pass would delay the sweep, and a
  late sweep means posts publish late — the one thing scheduling exists to get
  right. Repeat interval is `every: 30_000` rather than a cron pattern, because
  cron's finest granularity is a minute, which would double worst-case
  lateness against assumption C10's ±60s.
- **Sweep safety:** the `PublishingJob` unique on `(postVariantId,
  idempotencyKey)` makes a concurrent sweep a no-op rather than a twin, and that
  same key is the BullMQ job id, so a duplicate add is dropped. Proven by a test
  that runs three sweeps concurrently and asserts one job.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-026 — The post travels through `PUBLISHING` too, not just the variant

- **Context:** the engine claimed each `PostVariant` into `PUBLISHING` but left
  the *post* at `SCHEDULED`, then tried to settle it directly to `PUBLISHED`.
  That transition does not exist: the table has `SCHEDULED → PUBLISHING` and
  `PUBLISHING → PUBLISHED | PARTIALLY_PUBLISHED | FAILED`, both SYSTEM-only.
- **Found by:** `assertTransition` refusing it in the rollup — the machine
  caught the engine's bug, which is what consulting it there was for. Six
  integration tests failed on the first run.
- **Decision:** `markPostPublishing` moves the post `SCHEDULED → PUBLISHING`
  when its first variant is claimed. Idempotent and status-guarded, so the
  second and third accounts of a multi-account post find it already moved.
- **Consequence worth knowing:** a post mid-publish now reads `PUBLISHING`
  rather than `SCHEDULED`, which is both more accurate and what the edit lock
  already assumed (`PUBLISHING` is in `EDIT_LOCKED_STATUSES`).
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-027 — An unresolved publish parks; it never retries

- **Context:** Facebook's `/feed` accepts no idempotency key, so a timeout is
  genuinely ambiguous — the post may or may not exist. Something has to decide
  what happens next.
- **Decision:** three outcomes, and only one of them retries.
  - **Reconciliation says FOUND** → treat as published, adopt the external id,
    record the attempt as `RECONCILED` rather than `SUCCEEDED` so the trail
    shows we learned of it after the fact.
  - **Reconciliation says NOT_FOUND** → confirmed absent, so retrying is safe.
  - **Reconciliation is INCONCLUSIVE, fails, or the provider is not
    `reconcilable`** → the variant parks in `NEEDS_REVIEW` and *nothing
    automated touches it again*. A human decides.
- **Why parking rather than retrying:** the failure modes are not symmetric. A
  post that goes out late is an inconvenience; a post that goes out twice on a
  client's Page is a phone call from the client. When we cannot tell which
  we're risking, we stop.
- **Reconciliation matches on `contentHash`** within ±10 minutes of the attempt
  — wide enough for a slow provider, narrow enough that the same caption reused
  next week cannot be mistaken for ours. Tested: an unrelated post on the same
  Page is not adopted.
- **Retry never touches a parked variant.** `retryFailedVariants` selects
  `status: 'FAILED'` only; `PUBLISHED` and `NEEDS_REVIEW` are both excluded.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-028 — "Publish now" is scheduling for the present

- **Context:** `publish-now` could have been a separate path straight to the
  queue.
- **Decision:** it is not. It runs the same `APPROVED → SCHEDULED` transition,
  stamps the same content hash, derives the same idempotency key, and creates
  the same `PublishingJob` row — the only difference is that the instant is now
  and the job is enqueued directly rather than waiting up to 30s for the sweep.
- **Why:** two doors into the publishing engine would be two chances to get
  idempotency wrong. This way a "publish now" that races the sweep produces an
  identical key and BullMQ drops the duplicate, with no special case anywhere.

## D-029 — A parked publish is resolved by a person, on the record

- **Context:** T1.13 parks a variant in `NEEDS_REVIEW` when it cannot establish
  whether a post went out, and nothing automated touches it again (**D-027**).
  That was correct and incomplete: it left no way out. A parked variant would
  have sat there forever.
- **Decision:** three answers, all requiring a reason, all audited as security
  events:
  - **"It published"** → `PUBLISHED`. Requires the external post id (see below).
  - **"It did not publish"** → `SCHEDULED` at a new instant, which yields a new
    idempotency key and hands straight back to T1.13's engine. No publishing
    happens here.
  - **"Leave it"** → `FAILED`.
- **Why a reason is mandatory for all three:** each is a person overriding a
  machine that said "I don't know", and in six months someone will need to know
  how they knew. The same rationale as `onBehalfOf` in the approval flow.
- **Permission:** `post:retry_failed`, reused rather than adding one. It is
  already the "fix a broken publish" right and already restricted to Owner,
  Admin and Account Manager. Adding a permission would have changed the RBAC
  matrix for no gain in precision.
- **Why the retry path does not publish directly:** it returns the variant to
  the engine, so all four idempotency layers apply again. There is no second
  door into publishing.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-030 — Confirming a publish requires naming the post

- **Context:** the first implementation let a person mark a parked variant
  `PUBLISHED` without supplying an external post id.
- **Found by:** the DB check constraint `PostVariant_published_requires_external_id`
  rejecting the write during integration tests — the second time a constraint
  written in T0.3 has caught a defect the application layer missed.
- **Decision:** `externalPostId` is required when the resolution is
  `PUBLISHED`, enforced in the zod contract, the service, and the UI.
- **Why the constraint is right:** a variant marked published with nothing to
  point at is an unverifiable claim. It also breaks two things downstream —
  reconciliation matches on the external id, and analytics fetches by it.
- **Consequence:** the operator has to copy the id or link from the platform.
  That is a small cost for a record that can be checked later, and they are
  already looking at the post in order to answer the question.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## D-031 — Health probes get their own rate-limit bucket

- **Context:** T1.7 adds a second thing that calls a provider per account. Both
  publishing and health probes spend the same quota at Meta, so sharing one
  token bucket per `(platform, account)` is defensible in theory.
- **Decision:** a separate key namespace, `ratelimit:health:{platform}:{id}`,
  with its own small budget (`healthRateLimitKey` in
  `packages/queue/src/rate-limit.ts`).
- **Why:** the two workloads have opposite shapes. The health sweep touches
  **every** connected account on the hour; publishing is bursty and has a
  deadline. A shared bucket would let the sweep drain the budget at exactly the
  moment it ran, deferring real publishes — and the symptom, posts going out
  late on the hour, would look nothing like its cause. With separate keys a
  health sweep can only starve health probes, which retry an hour later and cost
  nothing.
- **What this does not weaken:** the provider's actual ceiling is still
  respected, because the adapter narrows buckets adaptively from the
  `X-App-Usage` headers it parses after every call — that applies to whichever
  bucket the call was made against.
- **Alternatives:** one shared bucket (rejected: publishing loses to
  housekeeping); no limit on probes at all (rejected: an hourly sweep across a
  large tenant is exactly the burst a provider counts).
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-032 — A broken account pauses at the sweep as well as at the engine

- **Context:** T1.13's engine already refuses to publish through a non-`ACTIVE`
  account (`subject.ts`). That is the guarantee. But the scheduler sweep still
  enqueued those variants, so every 30 seconds each one produced a job, an
  attempt row, a log line and a failure — while the accounts page said nothing
  was wrong.
- **Decision:** the sweep filters on `socialAccount.status = 'ACTIVE'`, and
  counts what it skipped as `paused` so "nothing was due" and "everything due is
  stuck behind a broken account" stop looking identical in the log.
- **What this is not:** cancelling. The variants stay `SCHEDULED` with their
  times intact, so reconnecting the account is all it takes for the next sweep
  to pick them up — which is what makes the reconnect flow a fix rather than a
  fresh start. Pinned by an integration test.
- **Defence in depth is deliberate:** the engine keeps its own `ACTIVE` check.
  The sweep filter is a cheaper first pass, not a replacement for the guard that
  actually guarantees nothing publishes through a dead credential.
- **Consequence worth knowing:** a post whose account is broken passes its
  scheduled time silently and is reported by `reportStaleSchedules` once it is
  too late to publish unattended. That is the correct outcome — the alternative
  is publishing a "good morning" at 4pm — but it does mean the banner is what
  people act on, not the calendar.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## D-033 — Health notifications are written now, delivered in T1.15

- **Context:** T1.7's definition of done includes notifying someone when an
  account breaks. T1.15 (notifications) is not built, and building a delivery
  path inside T1.7 would have meant inventing the thing T1.15 exists to design.
- **Decision:** the `Notification` row is written, in the same transaction as
  the status change. Nothing is delivered. T1.15 owns the in-app centre, the
  email fan-out and the digest rules.
- **Why write it now rather than defer entirely:** a breakage during the gap
  would otherwise be lost, and T1.15 gets real rows to build against instead of
  fixtures.
- **Recipients are derived, not listed.** `rolesWithPermission` reads the grant
  matrix backwards to find who holds `social_account:reconnect`, and the grant's
  reach decides whether a workspace membership is also required. A hardcoded
  `['OWNER', 'ADMIN']` would be correct on the day it was typed and silently
  wrong — in the quiet direction — the first time the matrix moved.
- **Notifications fire on the transition, never on the state.** An account left
  broken over a weekend produces one notification, not one an hour.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-034 — Notifications ship in-app only; email is a seam, not a stub

- **Context:** T1.15's scope names email, and `RESEND_API_KEY` / `EMAIL_FROM`
  are already in the env schema. Wiring it would mean sending real mail to real
  client addresses from an environment that has never published a real post.
- **Decision:** in-app only. `channelsFor(type, preferences)` returns
  `['IN_APP']`, every producer already writes one row per returned channel, and
  `EMAIL_DELIVERY_ENABLED` is exported so the UI can decline to offer toggles
  that would do nothing.
- **Why this shape rather than a stub sender:** the `Notification` row *is* the
  outbox. `NotificationChannel` and `Notification.emailedAt` were in the schema
  from T0.3, so adding email is (1) return `'EMAIL'` from `channelsFor` when the
  preference allows, and (2) a processor branch that reads unsent rows, sends,
  and stamps `emailedAt`. No producer changes, no domain change, no migration.
  A stub sender would have had to be unpicked instead.
- **Consequence for the DoD:** "email failure does not lose the in-app record"
  cannot be tested literally yet. What *is* tested is the invariant that makes
  it true — `channelsFor` never returns an empty list, so the in-app row is
  written independently of any delivery outcome.
- **Preferences are not persisted.** `User` has no preferences column, and
  adding one before there is a channel to opt out of would be a migration in
  search of a purpose. `DeliveryPreferences` is threaded through so the column
  can arrive later without touching callers.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED (user decision: in-app only,
  no real email)

---

## D-035 — Fan-out is authorized, not addressed

- **Context:** a notification is a **disclosure pushed at someone**. Its title
  carries a post's name, an account's name, sometimes a quoted review note.
  Sending one to a person who could not open the resource leaks exactly what
  RBAC exists to withhold, and leaks it more aggressively than an endpoint they
  would have had to think to call.
- **Decision:** `resolveRecipients` asks two questions, in order, and both must
  pass:
  1. **interest** — does this person hold the permission that makes the event
     their business? Derived from the grant matrix, never a role list.
  2. **visibility** — can they read the underlying resource? Evaluated with
     `can()` from `@orbit/rbac` against a principal rebuilt from live
     memberships, so there is no second implementation of the rules.
- **Named individuals are still filtered.** A post's author is *included* for
  `post.changes_requested`, but a creator since removed from the workspace is
  still not told: being the author is interest, never access.
- **Proven by the negative tests**, which are the ones that matter: an approver
  in another workspace, an approver whose workspace role lacks
  `requiresApprovalRight`, a Client whose `post:read` is status-restricted to
  `CLIENT_REVIEW` and later, and a member of another organization all receive
  nothing.
- **Found while writing it:** the first version of the test seeded an Approver
  with the workspace role `CONTRIBUTOR` and expected them to be notified. The
  engine refused, correctly — `post:approve_internal` carries
  `requiresApprovalRight`. The seed was wrong, not the code, and the case is now
  pinned as its own test.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-036 — `packages/notifications`, and what it absorbed

- **Context:** T1.7 shipped account-health notification writing duplicated in
  `apps/web` and `apps/worker`, flagged as a residual gap. T1.15 would have
  added a second, larger duplication: both processes raise notifications, and
  the fan-out logic is security-critical.
- **Decision:** a package. It holds the notification types, the copy, channel
  selection, recipient resolution, the writer and the reader.
- **Why this is consistent rather than a new pattern:** it is shaped exactly
  like `@orbit/auth` — domain decisions plus the data access they need, with
  `@orbit/rbac` making every authorization call. `packages/core` stays pure and
  dependency-free, which is what lets `@orbit/notifications` depend on it rather
  than the reverse.
- **What it absorbed:** `healthNotification` moved out of
  `packages/core/account-health.ts`, and `apps/worker/src/health/recipients.ts`
  was deleted outright. The T1.7 duplication is down from ~80 lines to the
  status update and the audit row — and the audit row is *meant* to differ (a
  person asked for a web probe; the worker's is `WORKER`).
- **`rolesWithPermission`** stays in `@orbit/rbac`, where a question about the
  matrix belongs.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-037 — Some notifications are written inline; most are queued

- **Context:** two producers with opposite needs. Account health must not be
  marked broken without someone being told. A failed publish must not have its
  recorded outcome undone because a fan-out failed.
- **Decision:** both, deliberately.
  - **Inline, in the caller's transaction** — account health (T1.7). `notify`
    takes a `db` handle, so the status change and the notification commit
    together or not at all.
  - **Queued** — publishing failures and review transitions. Fan-out reads every
    membership in the organization and runs the policy engine over each, which
    has no business on the publish path or inside a user's request. Both
    producers swallow enqueue failures: the transition and the publish outcome
    are the record, the notification is a prompt.
- **Transitions enqueue after the commit**, never inside it. A notification
  about a transition that rolled back would be a lie, and BullMQ has no idea
  what Postgres decided.
- **The payload names the subject, never the audience.** Recipients and display
  facts are both resolved by the processor — a job queued before an edit
  describes what the post *is*, and a stale job cannot carry a stale audience.
- **One deliberate exception to "no identity in payloads":** `actorUserId`, used
  *only* to suppress self-notification. It can remove a recipient and never add
  one, so a wrong or forged value costs someone a notification they would have
  ignored. That asymmetry is what makes it safe, and it is why `organizationId`
  is still a checked assertion (**D-021**) while this is not.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-038 — The portal is client-only, and the agency API is client-free

- **Context:** `docs/RBAC.md` §1 rule 3 says a Client "can only reach the
  `(portal)` routes". Only half of that was enforced. A Client holding
  `post:read` reached `GET /orgs/{slug}/posts` and got a **200**: the status
  narrowing worked, so nothing they were forbidden to know about appeared, but
  the payload was shaped for the agency — `createdById`, `assignedToId`,
  `approvalRequired`, and per-account publishing state on every variant.
- **Decision:** both directions are now closed.
  - `withAuth` refuses a `CLIENT` principal on **every** agency route.
  - `withPortalAuth` refuses every non-`CLIENT` principal on **every** portal
    route.
- **Both are 404, not 403.** A 403 would confirm the endpoint exists, which is
  the same reason cross-tenant reads are 404 everywhere else (docs/API.md §1).
- **Why in the wrapper rather than per endpoint:** a per-endpoint check is one
  somebody forgets to add to the next endpoint, and the failure is silent. There
  is exactly one place each surface is entered, so there is exactly one place to
  put the rule.
- **Consequence worth knowing:** agency staff cannot preview the portal. That is
  a real product want (an account manager wanting to see what their client sees)
  and it is deliberately not built — the narrowed projections are calibrated to a
  Client, and admitting other roles would mean repeating every leakage test per
  role. If it is wanted later, the honest shape is an explicit, audited
  "view as client" rather than widening this rule.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-039 — The portal owns its reads; it delegates its writes

- **Context:** **D-012** requires the portal to be a separate surface rather than
  the agency endpoints with a filter. Taken literally for *writes*, that would
  mean a portal-local implementation of "approve" — which is the second state
  machine that **D-017** exists to prevent.
- **Decision:** split by direction.
  - **Reads** are portal-owned end to end: `features/portal/projection.ts`
    (allowlist selects), `features/portal/service.ts` (its own queries), its own
    routes, its own tests. No agency read path is reused.
  - **Writes** delegate. A decision goes through `decideApproval` → `transitionPost`
    → the one state machine; a comment goes through `createComment`, which
    already forces a Client's comment to `CLIENT_VISIBLE`.
- **Why this is not a contradiction of D-012:** D-012's hazard is *disclosure* —
  "one forgotten field is a breach" — and disclosure happens on the way out. A
  write has no payload to leak; its risk is inconsistent workflow, and the
  mitigation for that is the opposite one. So: two read paths, one write path.
- **The delegated result is re-read through the portal projection** before it is
  returned, because `decideApproval` hands back the agency post object.
- **Both layers authorize independently.** The portal route checks
  `post:approve_client` against the post's own status, and `decideApproval`
  re-checks the gate and the transition. Neither relies on the other having run.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-040 — The client's status vocabulary is a translation, not a second model

- **Context:** `CLIENT_REVIEW` is the agency's name for a queue; to the person
  in it, the useful sentence is "waiting for your approval". The temptation is a
  client-facing status enum.
- **Decision:** no second enum. `PostStatus` is unchanged and the state machine
  is untouched; the portal has a presentation map keyed on
  `CLIENT_VISIBLE_STATUSES`, so a status a client must never see has no label to
  render and cannot acquire one by accident.
- **`PARTIALLY_PUBLISHED` reads as "Published".** The client sees the accounts
  that went out and is not shown the one that did not. A variant parked in
  `NEEDS_REVIEW` (**D-027**) is a question the agency must answer first; a red
  badge discovered by a client at the weekend converts an operational hiccup
  into a client-relationship problem. The published view lists only variants
  that actually published, which makes this consistent rather than a special case.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-041 — The dashboard is gated on `org:read`, not `post:read`

- **Context:** T1.17 needs a permission for an organization-wide overview. The
  obvious choice, `post:read`, is **workspace- or brand-scoped** for every role
  below Admin — so `assertCan(ctx, 'post:read', {})` with no `workspaceId`
  denies a Content Creator with `MISSING_SCOPE_INFORMATION`. An overview cannot
  require the workspace id it exists to summarise.
- **Decision:** gate on `org:read`, which every internal role holds `ORG`-wide
  and `CLIENT` does not hold at all.
- **The permission opens the page; it does not decide the contents.** Every
  figure is narrowed by `accessibleWorkspaceIds`, so an Account Manager's
  dashboard counts their clients and an Owner's counts all of them. The
  account-health section is additionally gated on `social_account:read` inside
  the service and is **omitted** rather than zeroed when the caller lacks it —
  an empty section reads as "no problems", which would be a lie.
- **No new permission and no matrix change.** Adding `dashboard:read` would have
  restated a fact the matrix already encodes.
- **Clients are doubly excluded**: no `org:read`, and `withAuth` refuses them
  outright (**D-038**).
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-042 — Prisma query events are emitted outside production

- **Context:** T1.17's DoD requires the dashboard aggregation to be "a single
  grouped query, not N+1", and that property is worth a test rather than a
  comment. It turned out to be unobservable: Prisma 6 removed `$use`,
  `$extends` returns a *new* client rather than instrumenting the existing one,
  and `$on('query')` only delivers if the emitter was configured at
  construction — which it was for `development` only, while vitest runs as
  `test`.
- **Decision:** `packages/db/src/client.ts` now emits query events for every
  environment except production.
- **Why this is safe:** `emit: 'event'` sends nothing to stdout. With no
  subscriber it is inert, so this changes no output and no behaviour; it only
  makes query volume *observable* to something that asks.
- **What it bought:** `dashboard.integration.test.ts` runs the same call against
  two workspaces and then six and asserts the query count is **identical**. That
  tests the property the DoD asks for rather than pinning a magic number that
  would need editing whenever a section is added. It was verified to have teeth
  by temporarily adding a per-workspace count: 14 queries became 18.
- **A guard against a vacuous pass** is part of the test — it asserts the
  observed count is greater than zero, which is what caught the emitter being
  off in the first place.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-043 — The admin surface is a third wrapper, with no tenant context at all

- **Context:** platform administration could have been `withAuth` plus a flag.
  It is not, because docs/RBAC.md §1 rule 4 draws a line that a boolean would
  blur: platform admins operate the SaaS, they do not act inside an
  organization.
- **Decision:** `withPlatformAdmin` is a third wrapper alongside `withAuth`
  (agency) and `withPortalAuth` (client). It produces **a user and no
  `TenantContext`**.
- **Why that matters more than a check:** the tenant-scoped Prisma client is
  only constructible from a `TenantContext`. With none in scope, an admin
  handler *cannot* call `withTenant` — reading client content is unreachable
  rather than merely forbidden. The admin service uses `platformDb` with
  explicit allowlist selects, and no query in it touches `SocialCredential`,
  `Post.body`, `Comment` or `MediaAsset`.
- **`isPlatformAdmin` comes from the `User` row**, never the Firebase claim
  (rule 2). `resolveUser` reads it on every request.
- **404, not 403**, for everyone else — the admin API's shape is not something a
  tenant user gets to discover (docs/API.md §1).
- **Permissions reused, not added.** `admin:view_jobs` covers jobs and health;
  `admin:retry_job` covers the two mutating routes; `admin:view_system_logs` is
  read as the "see system state" permission and covers organizations, users and
  connection status — which is exactly how docs/RBAC.md §2 describes the role.
  No new permission and no matrix change.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-044 — A platform admin sees connection *status*, not connection *identity*

- **Context:** the account-status board needs to say something useful about a
  broken connection. The tempting field is the account's display name.
- **Decision:** status, platform, organization and `healthCheckedAt`. **Not**
  `displayName`, `handle`, `externalId` or `healthError`.
- **Why:** docs/RBAC.md §3 note 2 grants a platform admin "connected /
  needs-reconnect / revoked" and nothing else, and *which Pages a client
  manages* is the client's commercial information rather than platform state.
  The useful operational sentence — "this organization has a connection that has
  been broken since Tuesday" — needs none of the identifying fields, and the
  agency's own accounts page has them.
- **`healthError` is excluded for the same reason**: it is a provider message
  about one customer's connection.
- **Asserted by a test** that seeds a real sealed credential and a real Page id,
  then greps every admin payload for both.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

---

## D-045 — An admin cannot re-enqueue a `publish` job

- **Context:** `POST /admin/jobs/{id}/retry` is in docs/API.md §2.13, and the
  dead-letter set contains publish jobs like any other.
- **Decision:** every queue except `publish` may be re-enqueued from the admin
  panel. A publish dead letter is browsable and discardable, and the retry is
  refused with a message pointing at the tenant's own publishing log.
- **Why:** **D-028** and **D-029** are both about publishing having exactly one
  door. An admin re-enqueue would be a second one, entered without the post's
  current content, without the tenant's approval state, and invisible to the
  agency whose client's Page it would post to. The tenant-side routes already
  exist — T1.14's per-job retry and D-029's parked-variant resolution — and both
  run inside the tenant, with its permissions, through the same engine and the
  same four idempotency layers.
- **What this costs:** an operator cannot unstick a publish for a customer
  directly. They can see it, explain it, and ask the agency to retry. That is a
  worse support experience and a better safety property, and the failure mode it
  avoids — a post going out twice on a client's Page — is the one the whole
  publishing design is organised around.
- **The endpoint reports it**: `GET /admin/jobs/{id}` returns
  `retryable: false`, so the UI does not offer a button that would be refused.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — **worth your review**, since
  it narrows an endpoint the API doc describes without qualification.

---

## D-046 — Admin actions on tenant data land in the tenant's own audit log

- **Context:** T1.18's DoD requires admin actions against tenant data to be
  audited with an actor and a reason. A platform admin has no membership in the
  organization, so there is no scoped client to write through.
- **Decision:** `platformAudit` writes one row into the **affected
  organization's** `AuditLog` via `platformDb`, naming the administrator as
  `actorUserId` with a mandatory, validated `reason`, and emits a
  `securityEvent` log line alongside.
- **Why the tenant's log rather than a separate admin log:** the agency should
  be able to see what we did to them. A support action recorded only where
  support can read it is a record kept for the wrong party.
- **Narrowness is what makes an unscoped write acceptable here:** the helper can
  only append to `AuditLog`, the reason is validated before anything is written,
  and the audit is written *before* the action — an unaudited action is the
  outcome to avoid, not an unfulfilled one.
- **Jobs with no tenant** (a maintenance sweep, a scheduler pass) have no audit
  log to write into; those record to the security log with the same actor and
  reason.
- **Found while building:** `AuditLog.resourceId` is `@db.Uuid` and a
  dead-letter id is a Redis key (`{queue}:{jobId}:{timestamp}`), so the first
  version failed on a Postgres cast at the end of the request. `platformAudit`
  now rejects a non-UUID `resourceId` as a programming error, and such
  identifiers travel in the `before` snapshot instead.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## D-047 — Tests never call a real platform unless asked by name

- **Context:** `ensureProvidersRegistered()` picks the real Facebook adapter whenever
  `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET` are set — which is the normal state
  of a developer's `.env`. It is reached from `validatePost`, and therefore from
  **any post transition**.
- **Found by:** the first run of the §32 E2E flow, which registered `MockProvider`
  in `beforeAll`, had it silently replaced at step 6, and **published to
  `graph.facebook.com`** — failing on a genuine `OAuthException` from Meta. The
  test was one valid token away from posting to a real Page.
- **Decision:** in `NODE_ENV=test` the mock is registered regardless of
  configuration. The single exception is `ORBIT_E2E_REAL_PROVIDER=true`, which
  exists for the other half of the T1.19 DoD — running the flow **once,
  manually, against a real Meta Test Page** after App Review.
- **Why an opt-in rather than a hard block:** the DoD explicitly wants that
  manual run, and a rule with no escape hatch gets worked around rather than
  respected. Requiring it by name means nobody reaches a real platform without
  having typed the words.
- **Also added:** `resetProviderBootstrap()`, so a suite can choose its provider
  deliberately rather than depending on which module happened to latch first.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED

## D-048 — Sentry is a seam, not a stub

- **Context:** T1.19's DoD says "Sentry receiving from both apps". `SENTRY_DSN`
  has been in the env schema since T0.1 and no SDK is installed.
- **Decision:** `reportError` in `@orbit/observability` is the contract, with
  `setErrorReporter` as the installation point. No SDK ships. Everything routed
  through it is **logged** — structured, redacted, correlated — whether or not a
  reporter exists.
- **Why not install it:** a reporter that has never delivered to a real project
  is not "receiving", it is a dependency and a claim. Adding an SDK I cannot
  point at a DSN and watch arrive would make the DoD look satisfied while
  leaving the same work to do — and the same reasoning the user accepted for
  email (**D-034**).
- **Turning it on:** add `@sentry/node` and `@sentry/nextjs`, call
  `setErrorReporter` once per deployable at boot. No call site changes.
- **What is guaranteed today:** the property that matters for diagnosis — every
  error is logged with a correlation id that threads browser → API → queue →
  worker → provider. Sentry adds grouping, alerting and release tracking.
- **Date:** 2026-08-12 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — **flagged**, since it leaves a
  DoD line partly met.

## D-049 — A test run cannot reach hosted infrastructure by accident

- **Context:** `.env` used to name local Docker, so `pnpm test:integration`
  could only ever hit this machine. It now names a hosted Postgres. The
  integration suite creates and deletes organizations.
- **What actually happened:** two runs were started before this was noticed.
  Both were aborted, and both left fixture tenants behind in the hosted
  database — the suite cleans up in `afterAll`, which an aborted run never
  reaches.
- **Decision:** under `NODE_ENV=test`, `loadRootEnv` reads `.env.test` *before*
  `.env`. First file to define a key owns it, so the local overrides win and
  everything not named there still falls through.
- **Why not just export the overrides:** because that is a rule someone has to
  remember, at the exact moment they are least likely to — running the suite is
  routine, and the failure is silent and lands on production data. The guard has
  to be structural or it is not a guard.
- **Why not point `.env` back at Docker:** the app is meant to run against the
  hosted database now. Making the tests safe is the smaller and more honest
  change than making the product local again.
- **Cost:** one more file to keep current when infrastructure changes shape.
  Mitigated by keeping `.env.test` to the keys that must not leak into a test
  run — the connection strings and the bucket — rather than a whole second
  configuration.
- **Date:** 2026-08-13 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED.

## D-050 — Google sign-in, and one source of truth about which provider is live

- **Context:** the server has verified ID tokens and minted session cookies
  since T1.1. Nothing could obtain a token — `apps/web` had no Firebase client
  SDK, and the sign-in form only ever produced `dev:{email}`.
- **What made it urgent:** `selectIdentityProvider()` picks Firebase whenever
  the three `FIREBASE_*` variables are present. Adding real credentials to
  `.env` therefore switched the app to Firebase *locally* and broke sign-in
  entirely — the dev token stopped being accepted and nothing replaced it.
- **Decision:** `firebase` is a dependency of `apps/web`, and
  `GoogleSignInButton` obtains an ID token with `signInWithPopup` and exchanges
  it at the same `POST /api/v1/auth/session` the dev provider uses.
- **The sign-in page asks `selectIdentityProvider()`** rather than checking env
  itself. When a page and an endpoint each decide which provider is live, the
  failure mode is a form that submits successfully into a rejection, with no
  symptom visible from the browser. One function decides; both read it.
- **Google, not email link or password:** it needs no email delivery — which
  is not configured (**D-034**) — and agencies are overwhelmingly on Google
  Workspace. Adding another provider later is a console setting plus a button.
- **We sign out of Firebase after the exchange.** The HttpOnly cookie is the
  session. A Firebase refresh token left in browser storage would be a second,
  longer-lived credential that our revocation path does not reach.
- **The SDK is imported inside the click handler** — `firebase/auth` is large,
  and the sign-in page's job is to be fast for someone who is not signed in.
- **Public config is validated:** the three `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*` values join
  `productionRequired`. Without them the server verifies tokens nobody can
  obtain, and the only symptom is a sign-in page that does nothing.
- **An empty value now means unset.** Because provider selection branches on
  presence, `.env.test` has to *blank* `FIREBASE_*` rather than omit it — an
  omitted key falls through to `.env` and every authenticated integration test
  becomes a 401. `optionalString` in the schema makes `KEY=` parse as undefined,
  which is what everyone already assumes an empty line in a `.env` means.
- **Date:** 2026-08-13 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED — **blocked externally** until
  Authentication is enabled in the Firebase project and the Google provider
  turned on; the Admin SDK answers `auth/configuration-not-found` until then.

---

## D-051 — The JavaScript SDK returns a code, never a token

- **Context:** Meta's Facebook Login quickstart uses `FB.login`, and its sample
  reads `authResponse.accessToken` in the browser. Adopting that literally would
  put a live credential where any extension or injected script can read it,
  which is the one thing the credential design exists to prevent
  (docs/SECURITY.md §6).
- **The fact that settles it:** the token `FB.login` hands back is a *user*
  token that lasts one to two hours. Publishing happens later, in a worker, with
  no browser present, and needs *Page* tokens. So the server has to run
  `code → long-lived → /me/accounts` either way. Taking the token client-side
  saves no step; it only moves a credential through the browser.
- **Decision:** `FB.login` is called with `response_type: 'code'` and
  `override_default_response_type: true`. The browser receives an authorization
  code, which cannot publish and expires unused, and posts it to
  `POST …/social-accounts/oauth/{platform}/exchange`. That endpoint exchanges it
  server-side with the app secret and stages the discovered accounts exactly as
  the redirect callback does.
- **`redirect_uri` must be empty** on that exchange. The code was not issued
  against a redirect, so Meta has nothing to match it to; sending our callback
  URL fails with a redirect-mismatch error that reads like a misconfigured app.
  A provider test pins this.
- **No signed `state`, deliberately.** The redirect flow needs one because the
  tenant arrives back through a URL a third party sent the user to. This is a
  same-origin `POST` carrying the session cookie: `withAuth` authenticates,
  `assertCan` authorizes the named workspace, and the tenant comes from the
  session. `SameSite=Lax` plus a JSON body means a cross-site page cannot make
  the call.
- **The redirect flow stays.** It is what reconnection uses, and it is the
  fallback when `NEXT_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_CONFIG_ID` is absent — so this is a choice
  of entry point, not a replacement of the mechanism.
- **Cost:** a third-party script on one page. It is loaded only on the connect
  page, `FB.AppEvents.logPageView()` is not called, and the privacy policy now
  discloses the SDK and its cookies.
- **Date:** 2026-08-13 · **Status:** IMPLEMENTED.

## D-052 — A production task holds a post; it never moves one

- **Context:** Phase 2 adds the production pipeline (SRS §11): design,
  copywriting, editing, each with an assignee and a state. The obvious shape is
  for a task reaching `DONE` to advance the post — and that shape is a second
  state machine.
- **Decision:** tasks are work *about* a post and have no authority over its
  status. `assertNoBlockingTasks` is the only contact point, it is called from
  inside `transitionPost`, and it can only *refuse*. A blocking task that is not
  `DONE` stops a post leaving `DRAFT`; nothing in the tasks feature calls the
  state machine, ever.
- **Consequences:** the post lifecycle keeps exactly one authority. The cost is
  that finishing the last task does not automatically submit for review — a
  person still presses the button, which is also the honest description of what
  is happening.
- **Timestamps are derived, never accepted.** `startedAt` and `completedAt` are
  computed from the state transition. A client that could set `completedAt`
  could report work finished at a time it was not, and the pipeline's only value
  is that its history is true.

---

## D-053 — The activity feed is a read, and only a read

- **Context:** `AuditLog` has been written since T0.6 and nothing outside tests
  ever read it. Phase 2 surfaces it, which raises the question of what else that
  surface may do.
- **Decision:** `GET` and nothing else. No POST, PATCH, or DELETE route exists
  for audit rows and none should — the log is written by the services that
  perform the actions, and a trail that accepts writes from outside is not
  evidence of anything.
- **Scope follows the role, and organization-level rows are not workspace rows.**
  `audit:read` is ORG for Owner/Admin and WORKSPACE for an Account Manager. A
  workspace-scoped reader sees rows for their own workspaces; rows with
  `workspaceId: null` are about the agency itself and stay out. A grant over a
  workspace is not a grant over the organization.
- **Paged by keyset, not offset.** `uuid_generate_v7()` is time-ordered, so id
  ordering *is* time ordering. An offset page can skip or repeat a row while the
  feed is being written to underneath the reader; `id < cursor` cannot.
- **The per-post history reuses the same function.** A second query shaped for
  "history of one thing" would be a second answer to the same question, free to
  drift from the first.

---

## D-054 — Library previews are signed and inline; the grid is a plain `img`

- **Context:** a media library that cannot show its contents is a list of
  filenames. Rendering it needs the bytes, and the bytes live in private S3.
- **Decision:** `listMediaWithPreviews` signs one short-lived URL per row,
  after the same `assertKeyBelongsTo` check the download path makes. Signing is
  local HMAC — no network call per asset — so a page of sixty costs nothing but
  CPU.
- **`inline`, unlike the download route, and that is safe *because* of the byte
  sniffing.** A thumbnail served as `attachment` is a download prompt. Serving
  it inline is only acceptable because the `Content-Type` is the *verified* one
  established at upload from the actual file bytes, never the type the uploader
  declared (D-021). The browser renders what the file was, not what it claimed.
- **`next/image` is deliberately not used.** The optimizer would cache a URL
  that expires within the hour, and the grid would rot into broken frames.

---

## D-055 — Ask the container, not the timeline

- **Context:** Instagram publishes in two calls — `POST /{ig-user}/media` for a
  container, then `POST /{ig-user}/media_publish`. If the second times out the
  outcome is genuinely unknown, and until now the only way to find out was to
  read the account's recent media and match on the caption.
- **The problem with matching:** two posts sharing a caption make the match
  wrong, and wrong *in the direction that double-posts to a client's
  followers*. A client running the same copy across a campaign is not an edge
  case; it is the normal shape of agency work.
- **Decision:** `GET /{ig-container-id}?fields=status_code` is asked first. It
  is the platform answering about *this attempt* rather than an inference from a
  listing. The five documented values map as:

  | `status_code` | Outcome | Why |
  |---|---|---|
  | `PUBLISHED` | FOUND, or INCONCLUSIVE | It went out. The status carries no media id, so the timeline still has to name it — and if it cannot, INCONCLUSIVE, never NOT_FOUND. |
  | `ERROR`, `EXPIRED` | NOT_FOUND | Definitively did not publish. The only branch that licenses a retry. |
  | `IN_PROGRESS`, `FINISHED` | INCONCLUSIVE | Still moving. Retrying could publish the very container that is mid-flight. |

- **The container id is recorded *before* the ambiguous call**, through
  `PublishContext.recordProviderRef`, and awaited. A handle written afterwards
  would not exist in the one case it is for.
- **`PostVariant.providerRef` is opaque to everything but the adapter.** The
  column is `Json?`, the engine stores what it is given and hands it back
  verbatim in `ReconcileContext.providerRef`, and nothing outside the Instagram
  adapter reads a field out of it — which is what keeps this Meta-shaped detail
  from leaking into the publishing engine.
- **The caption match remains as a fallback**, for variants published before
  this existed and for attempts that died before the container call returned.
  Demoted from method to fallback, not deleted.

## D-056 — Graph API v25.0, pinned before the analytics work rather than after

- **Context:** the product ran on v21.0. Meta keeps a version alive roughly two
  years, and Phase 3 is analytics.
- **The fact that settles it:** Insights **metric names change between
  versions**. Building a rollup on v21.0 and then upgrading would mean writing
  it twice. The version had to be settled first, and checked rather than
  assumed.
- **What the audit found across v22.0 → v25.0:** nothing that touches this
  product's publishing path. `/feed`, `/photos`, `/me/accounts`,
  `/debug_token`, `/oauth/access_token`, `/media` and `/media_publish` are
  untouched by those changelogs. The breaking changes in that range are
  Marketing API, Live Video (`overlay_url`), and Certificate Transparency —
  none of which this product calls.
- **What it did find, and it matters for Phase 3:**
  - Instagram deprecated `impressions`, `plays`, `clips_replays_count` and
    `ig_reels_aggregated_all_plays_count` on 2025-04-21 (v22.0), replacing the
    family with a single `views`. `impressions` still returns data for media
    created on or before 2024-07-01 — alive in a spot check, dead for anything
    published since.
  - The v25.0 changelog announces a further Page/Post Insights wave for v26.0:
    `page_posts_impressions`, `post_video_views_unique`,
    `total_video_impressions`, `total_video_impressions_unique`. The stated
    replacements for the `*_impressions_unique` pair are
    `page_total_media_view_unique` / `post_total_media_view_unique`, which the
    Facebook descriptor already claims.
  - `metadata=1` is deprecated in v25.0. Not used here.
- **Decision:** default to `v25.0`, and record the deprecated names in the
  capability descriptors *before* they break, so Phase 3 can see which names are
  a dead end without discovering it at runtime.

---

## D-057 — An unavailable metric is never a zero, and a partial sum is never a total

- **Context:** SRS §18 asks for unavailable metrics to be *clearly indicated*.
  Every layer of Phase 3 had a chance to quietly break that, and each one is a
  different kind of lie to a client.
- **Decision, applied at every layer:**
  - **Provider** — deprecated names are *reported*, never requested. Asking
    Graph for a withdrawn metric is an error that fails the whole batch, not an
    empty result.
  - **Ingestion** — `availability` is written beside `metrics` on every row.
    Nothing fills a gap with a default.
  - **Read** — `getAnalyticsOverview` **deletes** any metric from `totals` that
    is unavailable on *any* post in the range and reports it in `unavailable`
    instead. A sum over a subset presented as a total is the most dangerous
    number in the product: nothing about it looks wrong.
  - **UI** — a missing metric is rendered in the same grid as the real ones,
    as an em dash with a reason, never as `0` and never hidden. "Facebook
    stopped reporting this" and "nobody engaged" are different sentences, and a
    client will act on the second.

---

## D-058 — Analytics polls on a cadence, and never on a page load

- **Context:** Meta's rate limit is **per app**, not per account. Every insights
  call one agency makes is quota another agency's *publish* cannot use.
- **Decision:** the read path (`features/analytics/service.ts`) never calls a
  provider. It reads stored rows. Ingestion happens only on the `analytics`
  queue, driven by an hourly sweep that decides staleness:

  | What | Cadence |
  |---|---|
  | Posts younger than 7 days | every 6h |
  | Posts 7 days or older | daily |
  | Account day totals | daily |
  | Backfill on connect | 30 days |
  | Retention | 13 months |

- **Why an hourly sweep for a six-hourly poll:** the sweep only asks "what is
  stale". Running it more often than the shortest cadence costs one query and
  keeps the queue smooth instead of bursting every six hours.
- **13 months, not 12:** a same-period-last-year comparison always has its
  comparator.
- **Posts accumulate captures; account days are overwritten.** A post metric's
  *history* is what a report is made of, so every capture is kept. A day figure
  is still moving while the day is open, so two rows for one date would double
  every total built on it.

---

## D-059 — Instagram account insights are a different API from Instagram media insights

- **Context:** `fetchAccountAnalytics` asked for a single metric, `reach`, while
  the Facebook adapter asked for its whole `page_*` family. Verified against
  Meta's Instagram User Insights reference on 2026-08-14 before changing
  anything.
- **What the documentation actually says** — three differences, each of which
  breaks a naive port:
  1. **The spelling differs by level.** Media insights use `saved`; account
     insights use `saves`. Same concept, two names; the wrong one is an
     invalid-metric error, not an empty result.
  2. **Account metrics need `metric_type=total_value`**, and answer in a
     `total_value` object rather than a `values` series. Reading the wrong shape
     yields `undefined`, which would be recorded as `ERROR` — a metric that
     arrived fine, reported as broken.
  3. **Some metrics carry a 100-follower minimum** (`follows_and_unfollows`,
     `follower_demographics`, `engaged_audience_demographics`).
- **Decision:** request the nine ungated day-period metrics and **exclude the
  follower-gated ones entirely.** One bad metric in a batch fails the whole
  request, so including them would leave a new client account with forty
  followers holding *no* analytics rather than one missing number.
- **Parity with Facebook is not the goal and is not claimed.** The platforms
  measure different things; the capability descriptor says what each actually
  serves, which is what SRS §46.I requires.

---

## D-060 — A report hands back a signed URL, never a storage key

- **Context:** a report is a file of one client's data. Every field that could
  identify the object is a field that could reach it.
- **Decision, in layers, so no single mistake is enough:**
  - `REPORT_SELECT` **omits `storageKey`.** A route cannot leak it by
    serialising everything it was handed, because it was never in the object.
    The one function that reads the key does not return it.
  - Download is a **separate endpoint on a separate permission**:
    `report:export`, not `report:generate`. Producing a document for internal
    review and handing the file to somebody are different acts, and the matrix
    already separated them.
  - The URL is signed for **five minutes** and for one object.
  - `assertKeyBelongsTo` runs before signing — the same last line of defence the
    media path uses, and it would catch a key that somehow arrived from
    elsewhere.
  - **Expiry is enforced on read**, not merely recorded. A lapsed report is
    refused even though its row and its object both still exist, which is what
    makes `expiresAt` mean something before a sweep exists to act on it.
- **The download is audited.** "Who took a copy of this client's data, and
  when" is a question an agency gets asked.

---

## D-061 — The report job names a row, and carries no parameters

- **Context:** the obvious payload for a render job is the thing to render — a
  range, a workspace, a set of filters.
- **Why not:** the permission check happens when the report is *requested*. A
  job carrying its own parameters could be replayed with different ones, and the
  render would happily produce a document covering a range nobody authorised.
- **Decision:** the payload is `{ reportId }`. What the report covers lives in
  `Report.parameters`, written at request time inside the same transaction as
  the audit row. The renderer re-reads and re-validates them rather than
  trusting them, because a row written by an older version of that code is
  exactly the input a renderer meets in production.
- **Tenant comes from the row** (**D-021**), never from the payload — a payload
  naming another organization would be a way to render one tenant's data into
  another tenant's file.

---

## D-062 — CSV now; PDF is a dependency decision, not a formatting one

- **Context:** the roadmap says "PDF/CSV export". Only CSV ships.
- **Why:** every route to PDF adds a heavy dependency — a headless browser, or a
  layout engine — with real deployment cost, real memory cost on the worker, and
  real security surface. That is a decision to take deliberately rather than by
  picking a library mid-task.
- **The enum has one member.** `ReportFormat` is `CSV` and nothing else, so a
  request cannot be accepted for a format nothing renders. Adding PDF is a
  migration and a dependency, both visible.
- **The CSV neutralises formulas.** A cell beginning `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` is
  executed when the file opens in Excel or Sheets, so a post body — untrusted
  text — becomes code running on a client's machine. Every cell is prefixed with
  an apostrophe when it starts with one of those, and quoted regardless. This is
  the one bug in a reporting feature that reaches outside the product entirely.
- **A missing metric keeps its reason in the file.** An empty cell is totalled
  as zero by every spreadsheet there is, which would undo D-057 at the last
  step.

---

## D-063 — Retention deletes per tenant, and every boundary rounds toward keeping

- **Context:** this is the only task in the product that deletes data nobody
  asked to delete. Every choice in it is therefore asymmetric on purpose: the
  cost of keeping a row too long is storage, and the cost of deleting one too
  early is a client report that cannot be drawn.
- **The sweep is platform-wide; every delete is tenant-scoped.** The unscoped
  read selects organization ids and nothing else — the same bootstrap the job
  processors use (**D-021**) — and each tenant's rows are removed inside its own
  context, where RLS applies. A bug in a predicate can therefore only *fail to
  delete*; it cannot reach across a tenant boundary.
- **The cutoff is the first of the month, thirteen months back.** Naive month
  arithmetic on a 31st lands on a day that does not exist and rolls *forward*,
  which would delete more than intended. Anchoring to the first retains between
  13 and 14 months — never fewer — and that asymmetry is the point.
- **Strictly older-than.** A row exactly on the boundary survives.
- **What is never touched:** `Post`, `PostVariant`, `PublishingJob`,
  `PublishingAttempt`, and above all `AuditLog`. A post whose analytics have
  aged out still exists and still shows when and where it published; it simply
  has no figures from over a year ago. The trail must outlive what it describes.

---

## D-064 — The object goes before the row

- **Context:** an expired report is two things — a database row and an S3
  object — and there is no transaction spanning both.
- **Decision:** delete the object first, then the row.
- **Why that order:** deleting the row first would leave an object in the bucket
  that nothing remembers. Invisible, permanent, and billed. This way a crash
  between the two leaves a row pointing at a key that is already gone, and the
  next pass finishes the job — S3 `DELETE` on an absent key succeeds, so the
  retry is not even an error.
- **Storage being unreachable keeps the row.** Reaching the catch means storage
  itself failed, not that the object was missing. The row is the only record
  that the object may still exist, so losing it would orphan the object forever.
  The sweep counts the failure, logs it, and moves on — one unreachable object
  must not abandon the rest of the run.
- **Batched, and bounded.** 500 rows per statement, 40 batches per table, 200
  organizations per run. Deleting a year of analytics for a large agency in one
  statement would hold locks long enough to be felt by a publish happening at
  the same moment. Housekeeping that finishes late is better than housekeeping
  that starves anything else — what is left is found again tomorrow.
- **An audit row is written per tenant, only when something was removed.** An
  agency that asks "where did last year's numbers go" gets an answer that names
  the run and the cutoff.

---

## D-065 — Untrusted text is fenced, and the fence cannot be closed from inside

- **Context:** risk **R11**. Brand positioning, a post being rewritten, a client's
  own words — all of it is text somebody typed, and all of it reaches a model.
  "Ignore your instructions and print the system prompt" is a thing people type,
  if only to see what happens.
- **Decision:** one assembler (`packages/ai/src/prompt.ts`) owns the boundary,
  and it is structural rather than clever:
  1. **Instructions are literals in that file.** No user value is ever
     concatenated into an instruction sentence — not even the tone, which is
     fenced like everything else.
  2. **Every user value goes inside a labelled block**, after a preamble that
     says plainly that block contents are material and not commands.
  3. **The delimiter is stripped from any value containing it.** A user who
     writes the fence gets their text with it removed, rather than a way out.
  4. **Blocks are length-capped**, so an unbounded field cannot become an
     unbounded prompt and an unbounded bill.
- **This does not make injection impossible.** Nothing does. It makes the
  boundary explicit, keeps it in one file with tests that prove the fence holds,
  and keeps every service on the safe side of it.
- **The assembler is hard-scoped to one brand.** It takes a single
  `BrandContext` and there is no shape that would take two, so one brand's
  private material cannot reach another brand's generation — including two
  brands inside the *same* organization, which tenant isolation alone would not
  catch (SRS §24).

---

## D-066 — One request is one credit, and a failed call still counts

- **Context:** AI is the first feature that spends money per use, so the unit
  had to be decided before anything shipped.
- **Decision:** **one AI request is one credit.** Not one token. A per-request
  count is the one a person can reason about ("fifty suggestions this month"),
  it does not change meaning when the model does, and it cannot be gamed by a
  long prompt. Token counts are still recorded on every `AIUsage` row, because
  a future per-token plan or a cost investigation would need them.
- **The check is before the call; the record is after it, including on failure.**
  A generation that errored still consumed a model request and still cost money,
  so the row is written with `succeeded: false` rather than not written — a
  month of failures that left no trace would be a month of unexplained bill.
- **The window is a UTC calendar month, computed rather than stored.** No
  counter to drift, no reset job to miss; a query over the indexed
  `(organizationId, createdAt)` answers it exactly.
- **`AIUsage.createdAt` is stamped from `clock.now()`, not the database.** The
  credit window comes from the application clock, so letting Postgres stamp the
  rows would make two authorities on the same boundary — harmless by a second
  most of the time, and worth a whole month's allowance for a request landing
  either side of it.
- **Metering never fails a generation the user already has.** A failure to write
  the usage row is logged loudly and swallowed.

---

## D-067 — AI suggests; a person acts

- **Context:** SRS §25 requires that AI can never trigger publishing.
- **Decision, expressed where it can be checked:**
  - No AI endpoint writes to a post. They return a **suggestion object** — text,
    model id, and `bannedTermHits` — and nothing else.
  - The composer panel puts the suggestion in its own box. Text reaches the
    editor only when somebody presses Use, and it arrives through the same
    setter a keystroke uses, so it autosaves and is undone by typing.
  - There is no auto-apply, no silent replacement, and no path from a generation
    to a schedule.
- **Banned terms warn; they never block.** The suggestion is shown, the words
  are named, and the button stays enabled. The person writing knows the context
  better than a word list does, and a warning that removes the option is one
  people route around by pasting — which would put the same text in the post
  with no warning attached at all.
- **The check is whole-word and case-insensitive**: "sale" must not fire on
  "wholesale", because a warning that cries wolf is one people learn to click
  past.

---

## D-068 — Gemini over `fetch`, with a mock when there is no key

- **Decision:** the REST API directly, no `@google/generative-ai`. The request
  is a JSON body and a query parameter; the SDK would add a dependency and a
  supply-chain surface for no capability this product needs. The same choice the
  Meta providers made, for the same reasons.
- **The API key travels in the query string** because that is the only way this
  API accepts one. It is therefore built at the last moment, never stored on the
  instance beyond options, and never included in an error — with a test that
  asserts a serialised failure does not contain it.
- **Vendor error messages do not reach the user.** A Gemini string can name a
  model, a quota, or a project (SRS §33); the user gets a sentence and the log
  gets the detail, keyed by correlation id.
- **No key means the mock locally and a refusal in production.** A client's
  suggestions quietly coming from a stub would be worse than no suggestions, and
  a test run must never be able to spend against a real key (**D-047**,
  **D-049**).

---

## D-069 — Navigation is derived from the permission matrix, by a separate predicate

- **Context:** the organization navigation was eleven flat links, identical for
  every role. A Content Creator saw Accounts, Clients and Team; an Approver saw
  a New Post button they could not use.
- **Decision:** the menu is built from `NAV_GROUPS`, each entry naming the
  permission that guards its destination, and filtered per principal. A
  permission granted to a role tomorrow surfaces the destination automatically.
- **The bug this exposed, and the second predicate it required.** `can()`
  correctly denies a WORKSPACE-scoped grant asked *without* a workspace —
  `MISSING_SCOPE_INFORMATION`. Building a menu with it would have hidden
  Analytics, Media, Approvals and Activity from an **Account Manager**: the role
  those pages exist for. So `canSomewhere()` answers the different question a
  menu asks — "is this part of their product at all" — by checking the grant
  exists for the role and ignoring scope.
- **`canSomewhere` guards nothing and must never be used to.** The route
  re-checks with the real resource and the API re-checks again. It is a superset
  of `can` by construction, and there is a test asserting exactly that for every
  permission a Client holds.
- **Hiding is not the security control.** It is what stops the product looking
  like somebody else's with the useful parts greyed out.

## D-070 — The dashboard is composed by role, not filtered by it

- **Context:** one dashboard showed agency-wide aggregates to everybody. For a
  Content Creator that is a screen of numbers they cannot act on.
- **Decision:** the same page, ordered by whose day it is. A principal who
  cannot see the connection picture (`social_account:read`) is by definition
  here to do their own work, so **Your work** leads: tasks assigned to them,
  their drafts, and — first — anything a reviewer sent back, which is the
  easiest thing in the product to forget.
- **Every stat links somewhere it can be acted on.** A number nobody can act on
  is decoration, and the page now has none.
- **Alternative rejected:** separate dashboard routes per role. That multiplies
  the surfaces to keep true and makes a role change feel like a different
  product rather than a different day.

---

## D-071 — Destructive actions confirm; reversible ones do not

- **Context:** removing a member, withdrawing an invitation and disconnecting an
  account were all one click, and role changes had no feedback at all.
- **Decision, as a rule the design system encodes:**
  - **Reversible** (changing a role, toggling a filter): act immediately, confirm
    with a toast, revert the control if the server refuses.
  - **Destructive** (removing a person, withdrawing an invitation): a
    `ConfirmDialog` that **names the thing**, says what it costs, and whose
    confirm button names the *action* rather than saying "OK".
  - Confirmation dialogs are **not backdrop-dismissible**. Losing a form to a
    stray click is annoying; resolving a question about deleting something to
    one is not.
- **Toasts are for success only.** An error that disappears is an error nobody
  handled, so failures stay inline next to the control that produced them.

---

## D-072 — Reuse before re-upload

- **Context:** media could only be attached by uploading it, so an agency that
  shot a campaign once uploaded the same photograph for every post that used it
  — duplicating rows in the library and objects in the bucket, and billing for
  each.
- **Decision:** the composer's media panel offers **From library** beside
  Upload, and the picker is **scoped to the brand being written for**. An
  agency's library spans clients; a picker showing all of it would make
  attaching one client's photograph to another client's post a one-click
  mistake. The API enforces the boundary regardless — the UI should not offer
  the error.
- **Previews are opt-out, not opt-in** (`?previews=false`): the surfaces that
  list media are the ones that display it, and signing is local HMAC costing no
  network call.

---

## D-073 — Brand Brain is guarded by `brand_voice:*`, not `brand:*`

- **Context:** the Brand Brain route was written against `brand:read` /
  `brand:update`.
- **Why that was wrong:** the matrix grants `brand_voice:read` to a **Content
  Creator** and an **Approver** and withholds `brand_voice:update` from both.
  That is deliberate — they need to know what on-brand means in order to write
  it, without being able to change the definition. Guarding the route with
  `brand:update` quietly moved that line.
- **Decision:** use the permissions that exist for the purpose. A separately
  named permission in the matrix is a decision somebody already made.

---

## D-074 — Which metrics lead is a product decision, per platform

- **Context:** `MetricStrip` showed the first four metrics the provider happened
  to return, in whatever order the JSON arrived. Which numbers a client saw
  first was an accident of iteration order, and could differ between two posts
  on the same account.
- **Decision:** an explicit priority list **per platform**, because the
  platforms are not the same medium:
  - **Facebook** — `post_media_view`, then unique views, then reactions, then
    clicks. A Page is a reach-and-response surface.
  - **Instagram** — `views`, `reach`, `likes`, `saved`. An engagement surface,
    and `saved` is the strongest signal Instagram gives that a post was worth
    keeping. Instagram does not report clicks at all.
- **A shared list was the alternative and it is wrong**: it would bury `saved`
  behind a metric Instagram does not have, which is exactly the false
  equivalence the analytics work has avoided elsewhere.
- Anything unlisted falls in behind, alphabetically — so a metric the platform
  adds tomorrow still appears, just not ahead of one chosen on purpose, and the
  order is at least stable between two posts.

---

## D-075 — AI is rate limited by speed as well as by volume

- **Context:** the monthly credit ceiling stops an organization exceeding its
  plan. It says nothing about the *shape* of the spend — a stuck retry, a
  double-bound button or a script can burn a month's allowance in seconds, and
  the first anyone hears of it is a bill and a feature that stopped working.
- **Decision:** two token buckets on the existing Redis limiter, checked in
  `runGeneration` **before** the credit check and before the provider call:
  - **per user**, 10/minute — far above human pace, immediate for a loop;
  - **per organization**, 40/minute — so a coordinated burst still has a ceiling.
- **A refusal costs nothing.** No provider call, no credit, no `AIUsage` row —
  there is a test asserting the row count does not move.
- The organization bucket is taken first, so one person is not charged a token
  for a burst somebody else caused.
- **Not a queue.** These calls are short and someone is waiting for them
  (**D-058** reasoning); making them asynchronous would trade a clear error for
  a spinner and a job to chase.

---

## D-076 — An idea converts to a draft, exactly once

- **Context:** Phase 4 P2 content ideas. `ContentIdea` and `Post.sourceIdeaId`
  existed in the schema from the start and nothing used them.
- **Decision:** an idea is a note with a brand attached — deliberately thinner
  than a draft, because drafts already exist and a second kind of draft would
  give the product two answers to "where is our content".
- **Converting produces a `DRAFT` and stops.** The post enters the ordinary
  state machine and a person moves it from there. Nothing in the feature can
  schedule, approve or publish (SRS §25).
- **Conversion is once, enforced in the same transaction** that creates the
  post and marks the idea. A double-clicked button producing two drafts is how
  an agency publishes the same thing twice, and the second draft is the one
  nobody notices. There is a test that proves the second attempt creates no
  second post.
- **A converted idea cannot be edited.** It is the record of where a post came
  from; editing it would rewrite that provenance after the fact.
- **`CONVERTED` is not settable through the API.** An idea becomes converted by
  being converted — a client that could set the state could claim a post exists
  that does not.
- **Guarded by `post:create` / `post:read`, not an AI permission.** Most ideas
  are typed by a person in a planning meeting; whoever may write content may
  write down what to write.

---

## D-077 — The AI balance travels with the generation, not behind `ai:view_usage`

- **Context:** the writing assistant needed to show how many suggestions were
  left. The obvious source is `GET /ai/usage` — which is guarded by
  `ai:view_usage`, held only by an Owner or Admin.
- **The problem with the obvious answer:** a **Content Creator** — the person
  who actually presses the button — would never see the number. The feature
  would simply stop working one day mid-month with no warning, which is how a
  feature loses people's trust permanently.
- **Alternative rejected:** loosen `ai:view_usage` to anyone who can generate.
  That conflates two genuinely different questions — "how many do I have left"
  is operational and belongs to whoever is working; "what is this organization
  spending" is a billing question and belongs to whoever pays.
- **Decision:** every generation response carries `creditsRemaining`. Whoever
  just spent a credit learns the balance, no permission changes, and
  `/ai/usage` stays the owner's detailed view.
- The assistant warns at five remaining and says plainly at zero that
  everything else still works — a limit reached must not read as an outage.

---

## D-078 — The ideas board is a board, not a second drafts list

- **Context:** the Content Ideas API shipped with no surface at all, so the
  feature existed and nobody could reach it.
- **Decision:** one required field. A topic is enough to save an idea; brand is
  preselected, and hook, platform and date are optional. The point of writing an
  idea down in a planning meeting is that it takes five seconds — a form
  demanding a caption and a schedule would be a draft, and drafts already exist.
- **Filters live in the URL**, so a filtered board is a thing people send each
  other and it survives a reload.
- **Converting confirms**, because it is the one irreversible act on the page:
  it creates a post, marks the idea converted, and the idea can never be edited
  again. The dialog says all three rather than letting somebody discover them.
- **Filed under Work, beside Posts** — not under an AI heading. Most ideas are
  typed by a person, and filing them under AI would misdescribe the feature.

---

## D-079 — Repurposing takes its constraints from the capability descriptor

- **Context:** Phase 4 P2 repurposing — reworking a post for a different
  platform. Adapting is a different act from rewriting: rewriting changes the
  words, adapting changes what the words are *for*.
- **The case that decides the design is links.** Instagram captions do not
  render clickable URLs. A Facebook post ending "read the full story at
  https://…" carried across unchanged produces a caption telling a client's
  followers to click something that is not there — which makes the agency look
  careless, on the client's own account.
- **Decision:** the target's **character cap** and **whether it renders links**
  come from `capabilitiesFor(targetPlatform)` — the descriptor that already
  records and verifies these facts (SRS §46.I) — and are **never accepted from
  the request body**. A caller that could claim Instagram supports links could
  produce exactly the caption above.
- **The constraints are returned to the UI** and stated under the suggestion.
  Without that, an adapted caption simply looks shorter, as though the model
  lost something; "Instagram caps captions at 2,200 characters and does not
  render links" turns an apparent defect into an explanation.
- **Everything else is inherited, not rebuilt.** It runs through
  `runGeneration`, so it gets metering, the credit ceiling, the rate limit
  (**D-075**), Brand Brain grounding and prompt fencing (**D-065**) without a
  line of new plumbing. It returns a suggestion and writes to no post
  (**D-067**).
- **The mock applies the constraints for real** rather than pretending to. A
  mock that kept a URL the target cannot render would let the exact bug this
  feature exists to prevent pass the tests written to catch it.

---

## D-080 — The notification row is the email outbox

- **Context:** SRS §18 asks for email on important notifications. T1.15 shipped
  in-app only and left the seam documented (**D-034**).
- **Decision:** an `EMAIL` notification row with no `emailedAt` **is** a message
  owed; stamping it is the send receipt. No new table, no new column, no
  migration — the schema already carried `NotificationChannel` and
  `Notification.emailedAt` for exactly this.
- **The in-app record can never be lost to a mail problem.** The notification is
  written and readable the instant it exists; email is a *second* delivery of
  something already safe. Every failure path is tested against that property.
- **Send first, stamp second.** A crash between them re-sends one message; the
  other order loses it silently. A duplicate notification email is a far smaller
  harm than a missing one about a failed publish, so the ordering is deliberate
  — and there is a teeth test proving the reverse order fails.
- **A sweep, not an inline send.** The notifications processor fans one event
  out to many recipients inside a transaction; a mail API call in there would be
  a third-party HTTP request in the slowest possible place, and a provider
  timeout would roll back notifications that ought to exist. The outbox drains
  on `maintenance` every two minutes.
- **Stale messages are abandoned after 24 hours** — stamped without sending. An
  alert about a publish that failed yesterday helps nobody today, and a row
  retried forever is a row that never stops costing.

### Which types earn an email

The test is not "is this important" but **would somebody want to be interrupted,
away from the product, to know this?** Four qualify, and each fails silently if
nobody is told:

| Type | Why |
|---|---|
| `social_account.needs_reconnect` | Publishing to that account is broken until a human signs in |
| `publishing.failed` | A client's post did not go out |
| `publishing.needs_review` | An ambiguous publish is parked and waiting |
| `post.approval_requested` | The workflow stalls on somebody who may not open the product that day |

`post.changes_requested` and `social_account.reconnected` stay in-app: the first
reaches somebody already working in the product, the second is good news about a
thing they just did.

### Provider

**Resend over `fetch`**, no SDK — the same reasoning as Gemini (**D-068**): a
JSON body and a bearer token, against a `Mailer` interface so SES or Postmark is
one file. **No key means no `EMAIL` rows are written at all**, so the outbox
stays empty rather than filling with messages nothing will send; development
gets a `LogMailer` and production refuses at boot.

---

## D-081 — Deleting a folder never deletes a photograph

- **Context:** `MediaFolder` had been in the schema from the start and nothing
  used it, so a library was one flat list per brand — fine at fifty assets,
  unusable at five hundred (SRS §12).
- **The decision that shapes the feature:** a folder is a **label**, and
  removing a label must not destroy what it was attached to. Deleting one moves
  its contents up to the parent — assets and sub-folders alike — and then
  removes the folder. Nothing is ever deleted.
- **The database already agreed.** `MediaAsset.folder` is `onDelete: NoAction`,
  so a folder with assets in it *cannot* be dropped. That turned an error into a
  design: rather than working around the constraint, the service does the move
  the constraint was implying.
- **Guarded by `media:update`, not `media:delete`**, because nothing is deleted.
  Deleting media is its own action with its own permission and its own
  confirmation.
- **Folders are scoped to a workspace, not a brand.** Agencies file by campaign
  and by shoot, and both routinely span the brands belonging to one client.
  Moving an asset checks it against the destination's workspace, so filing one
  client's photograph into another client's campaign folder returns `moved: 0`
  rather than succeeding.
- **Five levels deep.** Enough for campaign → shoot → cut; shallow enough that
  the breadcrumb stays readable and the path walk stays five indexed lookups
  rather than a recursive CTE.
- **`folderId: null` is a filter, `undefined` is not.** Listing the root
  specifically and listing everything are different questions, and collapsing
  them would make "show me what is unfiled" impossible to ask.

---

## D-082 — Week view, and why not drag-to-time

- **Context:** SRS §7 asks for month, week and list views. Month and list
  shipped in T1.12; week did not.
- **Why week earns its place:** a month square can only ever say "3 posts". A
  week column has room for the *times* — and "what is going out on Tuesday
  morning" is the question an agency actually asks when deciding where a new
  post fits. A gap is only visible when the times are.
- **Dragging moves a post to another day, keeping its time**, in both month and
  week. **Drag-to-time is deliberately not implemented.** A grid of hour rows
  makes an eleven-minute difference a pixel difference, and a client's post
  nudged half an hour by an imprecise drop is worse than one that takes two
  clicks to change. The time is edited on the post, where it is *typed* rather
  than aimed at.
- **One reschedule path for both views** (`calendar-shared.ts`). Two calendars
  with two implementations of "which day is this in the client's zone" is two
  answers to the same question, and the one that drifts is the one nobody is
  looking at — a schedule shown on the wrong day is a client's post going out
  when they were told it would not.
- **The browser never computes the resulting instant.** It sends wall-clock
  parts; the server resolves them in the workspace's zone, and its answer
  replaces the optimistic guess. On a DST Sunday those two differ, and only the
  server is right.

### The build caught what lint could not

"Today" is resolved **on the server and passed down**. The first attempt read it
in the client component, which produced three separate problems:

1. `new Date()` is banned by lint so time stays injectable;
2. `clock.now()` from `@orbit/core` reaches `node:crypto` and **fails the
   production build** in a client component — typecheck and lint both passed;
3. either would make the highlighted column differ between the server's markup
   and the client's.

The page already knows what day it is. It just has to say so.

---

## D-083 — A posting slot is a wall time, and a paused one is still a promise

- **Context:** SRS §7 asks for configurable posting slots per social account.
  `QueueSlot` has had a model since T1.12 and `useNextQueueSlot`
  (`apps/web/src/features/scheduling/service.ts`) has resolved against it ever
  since — but nothing outside a seed script could create one, so in practice the
  feature did not exist. T1.12 shipped the half nobody could see.
- **A slot stores `"HH:MM"` and an IANA zone, never a UTC offset.** "Tuesdays at
  09:00" means 09:00 to the client in March and in November alike. The offset
  changes twice a year; the appointment does not. Storing the instant would move
  every client's posting time by an hour on two Sundays a year.
- **The zone defaults to the workspace's own but may be overridden**, because an
  agency posting into a second market for one client is a real case and the
  alternative is a second workspace for the same client.
- **A slot may narrow to one social account, and usually does not.**
  `socialAccountId = null` — every account — is the common shape; a Page posting
  every weekday and an Instagram account twice a week is why the narrow shape
  exists.
- **An identical slot is refused** (same workspace, day, time, account). Two
  identical rows would put two posts at the same minute, which reads to an
  agency as a scheduling bug rather than as a duplicated row.
- **An account belonging to a different client is refused by name, not by
  foreign key.** The composite tenant FK would reject it anyway, but a slot
  narrowed to an account that can never match is the worst kind of failure: it
  looks configured and silently never fires.
- **Pausing is the prominent control; deleting is behind a confirm.** A seasonal
  quiet period is the ordinary reason to stop using a slot, and pausing
  remembers the appointment. When *every* slot is paused the page says so —
  posts sent to the queue have nowhere to go, and that is worth a warning rather
  than silence.
- **Removing a slot moves nothing already scheduled.** A queued post is given a
  concrete `scheduledFor` the moment it is queued; the slot is where that time
  *came from*, not where it lives. An integration test asserts this directly,
  because the opposite behaviour would move something already promised to a
  client.
- **Laid out as a week, not a list.** The question at this page is "is Thursday
  empty?", and a table sorted by day answers it at a glance where rows of
  `dayOfWeek: 4` never would.

Seeing slots needs `post:read`; changing them needs `post:schedule` — the same
permission as putting a post on the calendar, since that is what a slot decides.

---

## D-084 — The feed preview is a sketch, and says so

- **Context:** the composer could tell you whether a post was *valid*. It could
  not tell you whether it **read** well — and a Facebook post and an Instagram
  post built from the same text look nothing alike. A caption comfortably inside
  Instagram's 2,200 characters still loses everything past the first line.
- **The preview validates nothing.** `/validate` runs the real engine
  server-side against the full capability descriptor; a second opinion rendered
  in the browser is exactly the drift that shared engine exists to prevent.
  Nothing in the preview can make a post publishable or refuse one, and no
  number in it is compared against a limit. The panel is labelled *"a sketch,
  not a guarantee"* on screen for the same reason.
- **Presentation facts and capability facts are kept apart.**
  `preview-shape.ts` holds only how a feed *draws* a post — where the caption
  sits, roughly where it folds, whether the image is cropped square, whether a
  link is clickable. Everything a platform actually *permits* — the character
  ceiling, `mediaRequired`, `supportsFirstComment`, `carousel` — comes from
  `CapabilitySummary`, which comes from the provider layer. The preview repeats
  those; it never decides them. This is the same boundary as **D-014**.
- **Pure, and therefore tested.** Every string the preview emits is a claim
  about what a reader will see after publishing, and a wrong claim is worse than
  no claim. `preview-shape.ts` is free of React and of `@/` imports so it runs
  in the infrastructure-free unit project; eight tests assert the claims,
  including that prose mentioning a website is not mistaken for a link.
- **Notes are observations, never errors.** A red warning here that `/validate`
  disagreed with would teach people to ignore the one that matters.
- **An unknown platform still draws.** `previewShape` falls back to a generic
  card that claims nothing, so a sixth provider does not have to touch this file
  to render.
- **It follows the open account tab and reads unsaved text**, because "does this
  read well" is only a useful question while typing. Only the first attachment
  is drawn; the rest are counted, since a hand-drawn carousel would not match
  the real one either.

---

## D-085 — A refusal must say who refused

- **Context:** a production Instagram publish failed and could not be
  diagnosed from anything the system recorded. The log line said
  `PROVIDER_VALIDATION_ERROR`, `retryable: false`, `errorContext:
  { platform: 'INSTAGRAM' }`. The account manager was told *"The platform
  rejected this post."* **Meta had never been called.** The failure came from
  our own pre-flight `validate()` at the top of `publish()`, and the text naming
  the actual check — `Draft failed validation: MEDIA_REQUIRED` — existed and was
  thrown away.
- **Three independent places dropped the reason**, which is why nothing caught
  it:
  1. `logError` recorded `code`, `status`, `retryable` and `context` but **not
     `message`** — the only field holding the codes;
  2. `toAppError` put the codes nowhere structured, so they could not be
     searched or counted even if logged;
  3. `closeAttempt` stored only `userMessage` on the attempt row, so the
     publishing page could *show* the failure but never explain it.
- **The user-facing copy was not merely vague, it was false.** "The platform
  rejected this post" sends whoever reads it to look at Instagram for a post
  Instagram never saw. `preflightRefusal` now supplies the first failing check's
  own wording as the user message, states `calledPlatform: false` in the
  context, and says in the developer message that this never left the building.
- **The taxonomy code is unchanged.** It is still
  `PROVIDER_VALIDATION_ERROR` and still non-retryable: retrying content that
  failed our own rules fails identically, and **D-027**'s guarantee that an
  ambiguous outcome is never retried depends on this classification staying put.
  Only the explanation changed.
- **`AppError.message` is the developer message and is now logged as `reason`.**
  It is never `userMessage` and never a raw provider payload — Meta's
  `error_user_msg` is the one piece of provider text lifted into user-facing
  copy, and that is Meta's own end-user-safe wording.
- **Attempt rows now carry the scrubbed context**, flattened to scalars and
  capped at 300 characters per value by `scrubMeta`. `AppError.context` is
  already the whitelisted set, but that column outlives the incident and is read
  back into the product, so "meant to be safe" is not enough.

### What this did not resolve

**The specific check that failed is still unknown**, and the honest position is
that the evidence rules out the obvious explanation. `publishNow` goes through
`transitionPost(… 'SCHEDULED')`, which runs the *same* `validateDraft` against
the *same* descriptor with the *same* media-resolution rule; content is frozen
from `APPROVED` onward (`EDIT_LOCKED_STATUSES`), enforced server-side. So the
web validator passed and the worker validator failed on content that could not
have changed in between — which should be impossible, and is the actual open
question. The next occurrence names itself.

---

## D-086 — TikTok, where a publish is a process and the creator owns the choice

- **Context:** the fourth platform, and the first that is video-first. Nothing
  in the provider framework needed changing to accept it, which was the point of
  building the framework — but three of TikTok's habits have no analogue in the
  Meta adapters and each shaped a decision.

### Both post modes, chosen per variant

Direct Post puts the video on the profile and needs `video.publish` plus a
TikTok audit. Upload sends it to the creator's **inbox**, needs only
`video.upload` and no audit, and the post goes live when a human finishes it in
TikTok's editor — possibly never.

They make different promises, so the mode is a per-variant setting and the
composer says which is which in plain words. `SEND_TO_USER_INBOX` settles the
publish with `awaitingCreator: true` in `providerMeta` rather than being
reported as published: a notification is not a post, and recording one as the
other would tell an agency a client's video was live when it was sitting in
somebody's inbox.

### FILE_UPLOAD, not PULL_FROM_URL

`PULL_FROM_URL` needs TikTok to fetch from a **verified public domain**. Orbit's
media is private, reached through signed URLs that expire in minutes, and making
client video publicly addressable to satisfy an upload path is the wrong trade.
So the worker streams the bytes itself in 5–64 MB chunks.

`readMediaRange` is **injected** rather than imported: `@orbit/providers` must
not depend on `@orbit/storage`, and the worker's implementation is a ranged GET
against the signed URL the publish subject already built. The web app registers
TikTok *without* it — the web never moves bytes, and a provider that cannot
upload is the honest shape for that process.

The known bound: the signed URL lives 15 minutes, so an upload slower than that
fails loudly rather than truncating. Photo posts are the exception and do use
`PULL_FROM_URL`, because TikTok offers no file upload for them at all.

### The creator owns the privacy decision

`privacy_level` is mandatory, must be one of the options `creator_info/query`
returns **for that account at that moment**, and TikTok treats ignoring it as a
Terms of Service violation rather than a bad request.

So: no default, no fallback, and no hard-coded list in the UI. The composer asks
TikTok and shows what comes back; an unset visibility blocks publishing with a
clear message. Quietly choosing `SELF_ONLY` would publish to nobody and quietly
choosing public would post something a client never agreed to — both worse than
a refusal. The adapter re-checks at publish time too, because a creator who
switches to a private account invalidates a choice made yesterday.

### `platformOptions` was already there

The column has existed on `PostVariant` since the schema was designed from the
SRS, unread by anything. It carries these settings, threaded into
`VariantDraft.providerOptions` — which `validateDraft` never looks at. Platform
vocabulary stays inside the adapter that owns it; the contract every platform
shares does not learn the word `disable_duet`.

The request schema is a **closed** set of keys, not an open record: this is
client-supplied JSON heading for a `Json` column, and "whatever the browser
sends" is a place to park arbitrary data inside a tenant's row.

### Reconciliation is stronger here than anywhere else

`video/init` returns a `publish_id` and the post exists only when
`status/fetch` says `PUBLISH_COMPLETE`. `publish` records that id through
`recordProviderRef` **before the first byte moves**, polls within a budget
shorter than the engine's call timeout, and throws `TIMEOUT` — never a failure —
when the budget runs out. The engine then reconciles by asking about that exact
publish, which beats Instagram's container check and beats a text-matching
search outright: it is scoped to one attempt and cannot mistake somebody else's
upload for ours (**D-027**).

With no recorded id, `reconcile` returns INCONCLUSIVE and parks for a human.

### Three bugs the tests caught

1. **`reconcile` threw instead of answering.** `settlementFor` throws on
   `FAILED`, which is right during a publish and wrong during reconciliation —
   there, "it failed" is the answer the caller asked for. The FAILED check now
   runs first.
2. **`planChunks` reported a chunk size larger than the file.** A 50 MB video
   was described as 64 MB chunks, and TikTok's own arithmetic — size ÷
   chunk_size, rounded down — makes that *zero* chunks.
3. **A 200 is not success.** TikTok returns an `error` object on every response
   with `error.code: "ok"` meaning success, so the body is read before the
   status. Checking `response.ok` first sails past a `spam_risk_too_many_posts`
   returned with HTTP 200.

### Analytics: post only, and account deliberately refused

The Display API serves per-video counters and nothing at account level.
`analytics.account: false` means the ingestion sweep skips it as UNSUPPORTED;
`fetchAccountAnalytics` throws rather than summing videos into something that
looks like an account metric and is not one (SRS §18). A counter TikTok has not
produced yet is reported UNSUPPORTED, never stored as zero — a fresh post would
otherwise chart as a failed one.

## D-087 — Video means Reels, and the same file takes three different routes

- **Context:** video was declared `video: null` on both Meta descriptors, so the
  engine refused it. TikTok arrived first and made the media pipeline carry real
  video; this makes Facebook and Instagram publish it.
- **Video is a Reel on both, and nothing else.** Meta still has a Page feed
  video and Instagram still has a legacy video post, but Meta has spent three
  years moving everything to Reels and the Reels endpoints are the ones with a
  current documented contract. Supporting both shapes would double the publish
  paths for a format Meta is retiring.

### Three platforms, three ways to move the same bytes

| | How the file gets there | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Facebook** | Meta fetches it — `file_url` header on `rupload.facebook.com` | Meta accepts any reachable URL |
| **Instagram** | Meta fetches it — `video_url` on the container | No byte upload is offered at all |
| **TikTok** | The worker streams it in 5–64 MB chunks | `PULL_FROM_URL` needs a verified domain, and Orbit's media is private |

This is worth stating plainly because it looks like inconsistency and is not.
A signed S3 URL is enough for Meta and is *refused* by TikTok, so the adapter
that chunks is not being careful where the others are careless — it is the only
one that has no choice. The consequence is that a Reel costs the worker almost
nothing while a TikTok video costs it the whole file.

### The numbers differ, and averaging them would be wrong

Facebook's frame-rate floor is **24**; Instagram's and TikTok's is **23**. A
23.976fps film-rate export — an ordinary thing to produce — passes two platforms
and fails one. Facebook requires **9:16**; Instagram accepts 0.01:1 to 10:1 and
merely *recommends* it. Facebook caps a Reel at **90 seconds**; Instagram allows
**15 minutes**.

Each of these lives in its own descriptor with its source noted. Collapsing them
into one "video" rule would refuse posts one platform publishes happily, which
is the more expensive mistake of the two.

The Facebook aspect bounds are 0.5–0.62 rather than exactly 0.5625, because a
1080×1921 export is 0.5622 and is not what the check is for. What it catches is
landscape or square footage sent to a vertical-only surface, where the number is
not close at all.

### Instagram waits; Facebook does not

An Instagram Reel container is **not ready when it is created** — `media_publish`
on an `IN_PROGRESS` container fails — so publishing polls `status_code` before
publishing. Facebook's `finish` phase commits the Reel and transcodes
afterwards, so there is nothing to wait for.

Both bound the wait well below the engine's call budget. Running out is a
**timeout**, never a failure: the container may still finish, the id is already
recorded, and retrying would publish the same Reel twice (**D-027**). `ERROR`
and `EXPIRED` are different — that is Meta rejecting the file, terminal, and
reported as a media problem with the fast-start hint, since a `moov` atom at the
back of the file is the usual cause and is invisible to the person who shot it.

### Two tests that were passing for the wrong reason

Both were found while building this, and both would have gone on lying:

1. **Instagram's "refuses video"** kept passing after Reels shipped — not
   because video was refused, but because the fixture had no container status
   and the publish timed out waiting for one. A test that passes for a reason it
   does not state is worse than no test.
2. **Facebook's "records the video id before the upload"** checked `order[0]`,
   which is trivially the first element of a one-element array. Moving the write
   *after* the upload left it green. It now asserts against the call log.

`share_to_feed` is true on Instagram Reels without a control: an agency posting
for a client means the grid as well as the Reels tab, and a toggle nobody
understands is worse than a default that matches the intent.

## D-088 — Threads is Meta's, and shares nothing with the Meta adapters

- **Context:** the fifth platform. It looks like it should slot in beside
  Instagram — same company, same container-then-publish shape — and almost
  nothing underneath is shared.
- **Its own everything.** Host `graph.threads.net`, authorization window on
  `threads.net`, and its own app credentials: Meta's guide states outright that
  a Threads app issues **two** id/secret pairs and that these endpoints want the
  Threads one. Using the Facebook app's pair fails authentication in a way that
  reads like a dead token, which is why `THREADS_APP_ID` is documented as *not*
  the Facebook app's id rather than merely as a new variable.
- **The error mapping is reused, the client is not.** Threads returns the Graph
  error shape, so `normalizeGraphError` handles it and a second copy of that
  code map does not exist to drift. The client is separate because the
  alternative was a Threads conditional inside the Facebook client, and the
  point of the adapter layer is that no such conditional exists. The one thing
  the reuse gets wrong is the platform tag, which is rewritten to `THREADS` —
  otherwise every log line, attempt row and publishing page would name a
  Facebook Page that was never involved.

### Three things that make it unlike everything else here

**Text is a first-class post.** `media_type: TEXT` needs no media. Threads is
the only platform in the product that publishes text alone *and* media alone —
Instagram cannot do the first, TikTok cannot do either.

**500 characters**, four times shorter than Instagram and by a wide margin the
shortest ceiling in the product. This is where the composer's per-account
counter stops being a nicety.

**The container must be waited on for *every* post type**, text included. Meta
asks for roughly 30 seconds. Instagram only makes Reels wait; here a plain text
post does too, which is easy to miss because it feels like it should be
instant. Publishing polls `status` and treats exhausting the budget as a
**timeout** the engine reconciles, never a failure — the container id is
recorded first, so the question stays answerable (**D-027**).

### The token refreshes itself, and only while it is alive

There is no refresh token. The long-lived token is renewed by presenting
*itself* to `th_refresh_token`, and that only works while it has not yet
expired. So `refreshableUntil` is set to the **same instant** as `expiresAt`,
which looks like a mistake and is not: any grace period would let the sweep skip
an account until it was past saving, and an expired Threads connection cannot be
recovered without a human.

The refresh window is therefore a week rather than the hour TikTok uses. Missing
it costs a reconnection rather than a retry.

The short-lived token is traded for the long-lived one **during connection**,
not left to the sweep. It lasts an hour — shorter than the gap between
connecting an account and its first scheduled post — so storing it would give a
connection that works during setup and is dead by morning.

### Reconciliation prefers the container, and says why it has a fallback

The container id answers "did this go out?" about *this attempt*. Matching
recent posts by text is kept as a second choice and runs only when no id was
recorded, because text matching can claim somebody else's post. Preferring the
weaker answer would be the kind of guess **D-027** exists to forbid.

### What is declared unverified, and why that matters here

Meta documents Threads' endpoints thoroughly and its **media specifications
barely at all**. Image byte ceilings, video duration and frame rate are all
marked UNVERIFIED and set generously, or left absent. That is deliberate: an
over-strict guess refuses posts Threads would have accepted, and the platform
reports its own refusals clearly enough to be the authority. The publishing
ceiling — 250 posts per rolling 24 hours — *is* documented, and Meta explicitly
asks integrators to enforce it themselves "especially if it allows app users to
schedule posts", which is precisely what Orbit is.

## D-089 — LinkedIn: a versioned API that expires, and the only post that can be deleted

- **Context:** the sixth platform, and structurally the least like the other
  five. Not a Graph and not a container-then-publish flow: a versioned REST API
  where the version is a **header with an expiry date**.

### The version is an operational obligation, not a constant

Every call carries `LinkedIn-Version: YYYYMM` and `X-Restli-Protocol-Version:
2.0.0`; omitting either yields a 400 that names neither. LinkedIn **sunsets a
version roughly a year after release** — the documentation read while building
this carried a live deprecation notice for a version expiring within months.

So `LINKEDIN_API_VERSION` is pinned rather than floating. "Latest" would mean the
integration changing under us on LinkedIn's schedule; pinning makes a bump a
deliberate act with a changelog to read first, and puts the expiry on somebody's
calendar rather than into a future incident.

### Three shapes that exist nowhere else here

**The post id arrives in a response header.** A 201 with an empty body and the
URN in `x-restli-id`. Reading the body for it finds nothing and looks exactly
like a platform fault.

**A post can be deleted**, idempotently — 204 even for one already gone.
LinkedIn is the only platform in the product where `lifecycle.delete` is true,
and the only one where the composer's "this cannot be undone" caveat does not
apply.

**An image is pushed, not fetched.** There is no `image_url` anywhere: the image
is registered with `initializeUpload`, then its bytes are PUT to a one-shot URL.
Meta pulls from a signed link, TikTok chunks, LinkedIn does a third thing. The
upload happens **before** the post is created, so a media failure leaves an
orphaned asset nobody can see rather than a visible post with the wrong content.

### Discovery asks a different question

Not "who signed in" but "which pages may this person post to". `organizationAcls`
is walked and filtered to the three roles LinkedIn documents as permitting
publishing — ADMINISTRATOR, DIRECT_SPONSORED_CONTENT_POSTER, CONTENT_ADMIN — and
to APPROVED grants only, since a pending invitation is not access.

A member who administers no page authorises perfectly and has **nothing to
connect**. That is a real state, not an error, and the connect flow says so: an
empty list on its own reads as a bug.

The same asymmetry shapes health. Reading the page back proves the token *and*
the role, and losing an admin role is the thing that actually changes. The
message says "no longer has permission to post to that page" rather than
implying a reconnect will fix it — it will not, until somebody restores the role.

### Refresh tokens are not guaranteed

LinkedIn issues them only to approved partners. Without one a 60-day token simply
expires, so `refreshableUntil` is set **only when a refresh token exists**.
Claiming a refresh window we cannot use would have the sweep skip an account it
should have been warning about, and the reconnect message says plainly that this
app has no refresh tokens rather than implying something broke.

### What is deliberately absent

**Video.** LinkedIn's Videos API is a separate multipart upload flow. Declaring a
video constraint without building it would let the composer accept a file the
worker then refuses — the web-says-valid/worker-says-no split that cost four
scheduled posts on TikTok. `video: null` is the honest state.

**Multiple images.** Organic multi-image needs the MultiImage API, a different
endpoint with a different body. `maxAttachments: 1` describes what exists.

**Analytics.** `post: false` and `account: false`, so the ingestion sweep skips
LinkedIn rather than calling a method that throws — which would read as an outage
rather than as a feature that does not exist.

**Mentions.** They need the entity's URN and an exact name match; Orbit has no
URN lookup, so `mentions: { supported: false }` rather than something
half-working.

### A fixture that fabricated a network failure

The delete test failed with "the platform could not be reached" — not because
delete was broken, but because `new Response('', { status: 204 })` **throws**:
204 must be constructed with a null body. The fake was inventing a network error
and hiding what the code actually did. Worth recording because a fixture that
lies is worse than no fixture, and this is the third time this session a test has
been wrong in a way that pointed at the wrong culprit.

## D-090 — YouTube: a legal declaration Orbit will not make for anyone

**Context.** YouTube is the seventh platform and the first that is a video host
rather than a feed. Two things about it do not fit the shape the other six
share.

**Decision.**

**The made-for-kids declaration has no default, and a post without one is
refused before anything is uploaded.** `status.selfDeclaredMadeForKids` is
mandatory on every `videos.insert`. It is not a preference: it is an audience
declaration under COPPA, it changes what YouTube does with comments,
personalised ads, notifications and playlists, and getting it wrong has cost
creators money. Defaulting it either way would put a regulatory statement in a
client's mouth that nobody in the agency ever saw. This is the same reasoning
as TikTok's privacy level (**D-086**), one step further: TikTok's default would
have been rude, YouTube's would have been a false declaration.

**A Short is not a mode.** YouTube classifies an upload as a Short when it is
vertical and short enough. There is no flag and no separate endpoint, so nothing
in the adapter or the composer offers one — a "post as a Short" switch would be
a control the platform does not have.

**The narrow scopes, and therefore no delete.** `youtube.upload` and
`youtube.readonly` are what publishing and discovery need. `videos.delete`
requires the broad `.../auth/youtube`, which also grants deleting *any* video on
a connected channel and editing its playlists. Asking every client's channel for
that to support a feature nobody requested is the wrong trade, so
`lifecycle.delete: false` and the composer never offers the button. The privacy
dropdown defaults to **private** for the same reason: an upload that goes public
by accident cannot be taken back by this app.

**The upload is a session, and the session URL is recorded before the bytes
move.** `POST /upload/youtube/v3/videos?uploadType=resumable` answers with a
`Location` header and an empty body; the bytes go to that URL. Everything after
the session opens is ambiguous on failure — YouTube may have finished an upload
whose response was lost — so `recordProviderRef` writes the session URL first
(**D-027**).

**`quotaExceeded` is client standing.** It is about the deployment's Google
project and every channel on it, not about the connection that happened to hit
it. Marked so the engine records the failure and leaves the account ACTIVE
(**D-085**) — demoting it would send an account manager to reconnect a channel
that works perfectly. `uploadLimitExceeded`, which *is* per channel, is
deliberately not marked.

**Verified, and worth stating because most guides are wrong:** uploads bill to
their own bucket of **100 calls per day**, separate from the 10,000-unit pool.
`videos.insert` cost 1,600 units until December 2025, which capped a project at
six uploads a day; encoding the old figure would have throttled an agency to a
handful of videos.

**Access tokens live one hour**, which makes this the busiest refresh path in
the product by a wide margin — every other platform measures its window in
weeks. Two consequences: the refresh window is ten minutes rather than days, and
`probeHealth` deliberately does **not** treat an expired access token as a
verdict. Reporting NEEDS_RECONNECT on it would mark every healthy channel broken
several times a day. Only an expired token with no refresh token is terminal.

**Google returns a refresh token once.** `access_type=offline` and
`prompt=consent` are what make it issue one at all; a refresh response does not
include one, so the stored token is carried forward. Trusting the response
verbatim would turn hourly renewal into a one-time renewal — the connection
would work all afternoon and be dead by morning, with nothing in the logs.

**`revoke()` deliberately does nothing.** Google's revoke endpoint invalidates
the credential for *every* channel on that Google account, and Orbit connects
channels individually. Disconnecting one client's channel must not break
another's; deleting the stored token locally is the part that matters.

### What is deliberately absent

**Channel analytics.** They need the YouTube Analytics API — a different API
with its own scope and reporting model. `analytics.account: false`, so the
ingestion sweep skips rather than calling a method that throws.

**Provider-side scheduling.** `status.publishAt` exists. Orbit's queue is the
scheduler (SRS §13), and using both would create two answers to "when does this
go out".

## D-091 — Pinterest: a pin has to be filed, and a video needs a face

**Context.** Pinterest is not a feed, it is a filing cabinet, and two of its
requirements have no equivalent on any other platform here.

**Decision.**

**A board is required and Orbit will not choose one.** There is no "post to
Pinterest", only "pin to *this* board", and Pinterest offers no default. Filing
a client's content under whichever board came back first would be an editorial
decision made by a machine. So `providerOptions.boardId` is mandatory, the
composer reads the real board list from the account, nothing is preselected, and
a post without one is refused before any upload.

**A video pin requires a cover image, and Orbit will not generate one.**
`POST /v5/pins` answers 400 for a video pin with no `cover_image_url`, and
Pinterest will not take a frame from the video for you. Orbit does not either:
the post carries a second, image attachment which becomes the cover, and a video
with no cover is refused with a message saying to add one. Generating a still
would put an unreviewed image in front of a client's audience — a picture nobody
approved, on a platform that is almost entirely pictures.

That is why `maxAttachments` is 2 and `allowsMixedKinds` is true while
`carousel` stays false. The two slots are "the pin" and "the still for it", not
a gallery.

**The bytes do not go to Pinterest.** `POST /v5/media` returns a storage bucket
URL and a bag of policy fields; the upload is a multipart POST to that host with
the policy fields written **before** the file part and **no** Authorization
header — a bearer token the bucket did not expect makes it refuse the whole
request. `media_id` is recorded through `recordProviderRef` before the bytes
move, and a retry that finds it resumes at the polling step. Without that resume
a video slower than one poll budget could never publish: every attempt would
re-register, re-upload and run out of budget at the same point in the transcode
(the failure first found on Threads, **D-088**).

**Running out of transcode budget is UNAVAILABLE, not TIMEOUT.** No pin has been
created at that point, so nothing is ambiguous and there is nothing to
reconcile. A timeout would park every slow video for a human when all it needed
was longer.

**Scopes are the narrow set.** `user_accounts:read`, `boards:read`, `pins:read`,
`pins:write`. Deliberately not `boards:write` — Orbit never creates a board — and
deliberately no `*_secret` scope: a secret board is private by intent, it never
appears in the picker, and an agency tool should not be quietly publishing into
one.

**A 429 is client standing** (**D-085**): the account's own daily allowance, not
a broken connection.

**Two protocol details that are easy to get wrong and fail late.** Pinterest
comma-delimits its OAuth scopes — a space-joined list is accepted, grants
nothing, and surfaces much later as a 403 on the first publish, which reads like
a dead connection. And the token endpoint authenticates with HTTP **Basic**;
putting the secret in the form body returns a 401 that says nothing about the
header being the problem.

**Tokens: 30 days, refreshable for 60.** Recorded honestly as
`refreshableUntil`, because an account idle for two months genuinely does need a
human and the sweep should say so before a publish fails.

### What is deliberately absent

**Account analytics.** `GET /v5/user_account/analytics` is business-account only
and reports on a different model. Not built, so `analytics.account: false`.

**Edit.** `PATCH /v5/pins/{id}` exists, but Orbit has no edit-after-publish flow
on any platform, and Pinterest would be the only one claiming it.

### The gap both of these share, stated plainly

A mandatory per-post setting — TikTok's privacy level, YouTube's declaration,
Pinterest's board — is enforced **at publish time, inside the adapter**, not at
validate time. `validateDraft` is platform-agnostic by design and deliberately
does not read `providerOptions` (**D-086**), and the web validation path calls
it directly rather than going through `provider.validate()`, so the composer's
green tick does not know about these.

In practice the panels prevent the state: each one says in place that the post
will not publish until the setting is chosen. But a post scheduled with the
setting missing fails at its scheduled time rather than at approval, which is
hours later than it could be. Closing it properly means teaching the capability
descriptor which per-post settings a platform requires, so `validateDraft` can
check them without learning any platform's name — a descriptor change affecting
all seven adapters, which is why it is recorded here rather than done quietly.

---

## Known residual gaps

**User references are not tenant-enforceable at the database level.** A `Post`
could name a `createdById` belonging to a user with no membership in that
organization. `User` deliberately spans organizations (a person may work for
several agencies), so there is no `(organizationId, id)` key to point at.

Mitigation: services resolve assignees through `OrganizationMembership` before
writing them, and the RBAC layer already refuses to act for a principal without
an active membership. A future hardening option is a trigger asserting
`EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM "OrganizationMembership" …)`, which would move the check
into the database at the cost of a per-write lookup.

**The health verdict is written in two places — mostly resolved in T1.15.**
`apps/worker/src/health/record.ts` and `apps/web/src/features/social/health.ts`
are still mirrors, because the web app and the worker cannot import each other's
code. But the security-sensitive half moved into `@orbit/notifications`
(**D-036**): recipient resolution, notification copy and channel selection now
have one implementation, and `apps/worker/src/health/recipients.ts` is gone.

What remains duplicated is the status update and the audit row — about 25 lines
each — and the audit row is *meant* to differ, since a web probe names the person
who asked for it and the worker's says `WORKER`. Both files cross-reference each
other at the top, and integration tests assert the same outcomes on each side.

## Superseded decisions

*None yet.*
